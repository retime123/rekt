<strong>So many sad stories.</strong><p></p><p>Individuals, protocols, CeFi, DeFi, VCs, hedge funds, all corners of the industry are reporting major losses, after being punished relentlessly by the unforgiving market conditions.</p><p>Over $2B in <a href=""https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData"">liquidations</a> since last Monday, when $685M was liquidated in just one day.</p><p><em>And it’s not just those who were leveraged who are feeling the pain.</em></p><p>Anchor was a <strong>“safe”</strong> place. Celsius was a <strong>“safe”</strong> place.</p><p>When everything is going up, a sense of security is easy to find, but looking back, you see that you were simply ignoring the inevitable.</p><p><strong>The top signals were especially blatant this time around:</strong></p><p>$1.3M rock NFTs, $1.4M Loot NFTs <em>(“someone else will build the game”)</em>, the boom and <a href=""https://rekt.news/whale-watching-bdp/"">bust</a> of yield farming, we’ve seen so much waste and so much greed over the past two years.</p><p>Yet despite this over-extended period of exuberance and gluttony, the latest market crash seemed to take even the most professional participants by surprise, as we hurtled with eyes wide open through various liquidation points, crashing helplessly from one crisis to another.</p><p>Aside from the clout farming contrarians who now have “mOrE tiMe tO BuiLD”, nobody is happy about the end of the bull market.</p><p>The bear is here, breaking assumptions you didn’t even know you had, and forcing uncomfortable decisions on all but a fortunate few.</p><p><strong>Your idols are long gone, your favourite fund was forced to sell, and even the most sickeningly optimistic influencers are showing signs of capitulation.</strong></p><p><em>The macro environment suggests we won’t be heading back up to the highs anytime soon, but we’re certainly closer to the bottom than the top.</em></p><p>All that froth and embarrassing publicity was simply a sign of mass adoption - something that we used to look forward to.</p><p>Now the limelight is once again focused on SBF, who remains as one of the few DeFi protagonists to not have been struck by total disaster. FTX has become even stronger during the market decline, as they’ve taken it upon themselves to bail out and gain influence over other centralised crypto organisations such as BlockFi (<a href=""https://www.theblock.co/post/148146/waning-institutional-demand-is-forcing-high-yield-crypto-accounts-to-slash-rates"">$15B AUM at peak</a>) and Liquid Group.</p><p>Celsius (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-becomes-first-cefi-or-defi-platform-to-cross-20b-aum"">$20B AUM at peak</a>) and Three Arrows (<a href=""https://coingape.com/everything-about-three-arrows-capitals-insolvency-risks-and-what-happened/"">~$18B AUM at peak</a>) are two other examples of what can go wrong when institutional credit is not transparent to retail investors. If all their business had been conducted on-chain, would we really have allowed it to go on for so long?</p><p><strong>Meanwhile, decentralised protocols have done exactly what they were built to do.</strong></p><p><em>Aave still lends, DAI is still stable, and LUNA made Do Kwon rich and famous.</em></p><p>The collapse of Celsius, LUNA, and Three Arrows Capital will bring harsh regulations upon the entire industry, and although those events make it hard to argue against said regulation, we can still hope that the hand of the law does not fall too heavily.</p><p><strong>A return to utility, and a focus on fundamentals, are the only cure for the pain that we’re now suffering.</strong></p><p><em>Bears can't live forever. Surely next time will be different...</em></p><p>?</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png""/></figure><p></p></section>"

Swaps are then routed through BNT to other assets, and any impermanent loss is absorbed by BNT emissions. Any LPs whose positions have incurred IL are issued the equivalent in BNT upon withdrawal.</p><p>The IL protection is funded by fees from protocol-owned BNT liquidity on the platform as well as using a proportion of protocol fees to buyback and burn vBNT; a gradual drip-feed which, it appears, is not robust enough to withstand the recent chaos.</p><p>The mechanism is shilled as “<em>Deposit one token, stay exposed to one token</em>”, but the LPs relying on BNT to make them whole, might now be experiencing more permanence on their losses than they were previously promised.</p><p>The scheme may be good for marketing, especially for LPs who are sick of <a href=""https://rekt.news/uniswap-v3-lp-rekt/"">IL outpacing their gains</a>.</p><p><strong>But everything comes at a cost.

<strong>Red candles burn the hottest</strong>. When the bulls stop running, fingers start pointing, and euphoria and greed turn to suspicion and accusation.<p></p><p>In the translucent waters of the crypto markets, hunters watch the whales with an eagle eye.</p><p>When the waters get choppy and profits are harder to come by, many smaller fish look to the whales for direction. Closer inspection combined with the slimmer pickings of a fickle market often reveals some questionable behaviour.</p><p><strong>Even Blue Kirby</strong> looks different in red candlelight. The once universally loved hyperactive YFI fan boy has faced his first public critiques over the past few weeks, first when he naively promoted the unaudited code of EMN before the <a href=""/eminence-rekt-in-prod/"">hack</a>, then after he dumped his YFI when the markets turned red.</p><p>It’s always interesting to analyse a change in public opinion.</p><p>Blue Kirby’s enthusiasm to shill EMN cost him dearly, forcing him to step down from his official position as Yearn comms / shillmaster.</p><p>Where the community had previously been happy to pay Kirby <a href=""https://gov.yearn.finance/t/nomination-for-roles-multisig-to-approve-execute/4549"">$7000 a month</a>, they were now protesting at his wallet with pitchforks, and when he sold the YFI on which he had built his brand, the replies to his tweets turned from disappointment to outrage.</p><p>Kirby claims his YFI sales were an attempt to gain some privacy, and that he planned to rebuy using a different address, but many were left wondering why he didn’t simply use a CEX to deposit his coins and withdraw elsewhere.</p><p>Selling personal assets which equal 0.08% of the total supply likely had 0 impact on the markets. What he did isn’t a criminal offence anywhere, but in the land of crypto Twitter, society’s laws seem to change with the markets, and Kirby was widely criticised for his actions.</p><p>In the typical Blue Kirby marketing approach, he turned the condemnation into promotion, and created the #blamekirby hashtag.</p><p>Blue Kirby has played crypto Twitter like a fiddle. He piggybacked on the success of YFI to quickly build his own brand, and despite his tarnished reputation and exit from the yearn team, he is now attempting to launch his own token.</p><p>Seemingly unphased by this blip in his relentless PR campaign, Kirby is conducting an ICO for his mysterious NFT sales platform <a href=""https://off---blue.com/"">Off Blue</a>, which <a href=""https://twitter.com/MarketStupid/status/1314558440392454145?s=20"">raised over $800k</a> in a matter of minutes, despite giving no details on what users were buying, or providing any public roadmap for the project.</p><p>Let's take a quick look at what their manifesto offers.

There has been lots of public debate and questioning about the use of FTT as collateral for short selling other assets.

Many assets can decline in price, but because FTT is a fully centralized token, if there is an issue, it can instantly go to $0, which is a safety risk for all C.R.E.A.M. users.</em></p><p><em>5 - SBF borrowed YFI which destroyed its price, he sold it on Binance and other exchanges - only once he was caught, did YFI go back up</em></p><p>The vote will be open until the 14th of October, so it’s too early to say how it will end, however, at the time of writing, the vote was 100% in favour of delisting FTT.</p><p>Although SBF clearly has the ability to purchase enough CREAM to swing the vote in his favour, forcing the vote in this way would not only have a negative impact on his reputation, it would reduce the credibility of the entire C.R.E.A.M protocol.</p><p>The founder of C.R.E.A.M, <a href=""https://twitter.com/machibigbrother"">Jeffrey Huang</a>, doesn’t seem to see anything wrong with how SBF is using his protocol, and has praised his actions; claiming they demonstrate a good <a href=""https://twitter.com/machibigbrother/status/1313887798923935750?s=20"">product market fit.</a>

It should be noted that the community is not just upset that SBF is shorting their assets, but that he is taking over a decentralised protocol by depositing his own centralised tokens, and using them as collateral to short other decentralised tokens.<p></p><p>SBF has spoken out on the matter to defend his actions. The fact that he had to do this is somewhat surprising, as one of the core values of decentralised finance is that the protocols are open to be used by anyone in any way that the parameters allow.</p><p>However, it can be argued that having access to such a large amount of centralised tokens gives him an unfair advantage, especially when the real market value is not likely to be the same as the value they have been given for collateral.</p><p><a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ftx-token"">Coingecko </a>lists a 24 hour trading volume of just over $2M for FTT. The most popular FTT <a href=""https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x36d6a86226d2fc54361241b8b030dd86bc55ed04"">pairing </a>on Uniswap has only $155.62 in liquidity.

When economically rational market participants such as SBF are able to take advantage these tools in a way that the community doesn’t approve of, the immaturity of both the market and its users are revealed.<p></p><p>When less influential actors such as Blue Kirby take actions that the community doesn’t approve of, they are putting their career at stake.

I haven't seen the nature of the threats but going through with the refund sets a very dangerous precedence where it reinforces the notion that threatening project members is a viable course of action to get your desired outcome.</p><p>The second perspective is obviously the moral hazard aspect which has been discussed at length already on CT. Austrian economists love to use the term “moral hazard” when describing interventionism, which in DeFi layman's terms refers to degens degen'ing on more and more risky and unaudited projects because they 'expect' to be partially bailed out in situations such as these. This type of risk transfer certainly exists in the real world where major banks have an expectation for the federal government to bail them out if they land on hard times. But do we really want to replicate this in the DeFi space?</p><p>Whoever exploited EMN displayed great initiative and ingenuity, but more importantly he/she essentially shared a blueprint on how to carry out a simple yet lucrative attack and divert attention back to the very project that they attacked, letting them take on all the misguided anger and threats. We may even start seeing this become the new norm for exploiters to tip the systems they've just gamed, akin to an unspoken code of conduct among thieves.</p><p>Wherever this latest incident takes us in the coming weeks, it's worth considering the message it's sending out to all the bad actors in this space or even the neutral ethically-fluid ones watching these perpetrators get away with it, time after time, with absolute impunity.</p><p><strong>ANON 2</strong></p><p>On the technical side, I think the implementation was a bit unfleshed out as it was deployed on testnet first.</p><p>Admittedly it's still relatively hard to fork mainnet and run locally to have uniswap, balancer or bonding curve testing so I can understand the “test as much as possible” but real testing happens in prod...</p><p>However that narrative opens the ground for shit developers and scammers, which given the amount of “Uniswap” rug pulls recently is awful.</p><p>I mean in hindsight it was <em>and</em> wasn't Andre's fault, considering there is so much hype around him that it was even a plausible idea that it could have happened.</p><p>I mean there's only so much you can cognitively think about when developing, you're more focused on the project roadmap rather than these extra degen defi risks that admittedly are still emerging.</p><p>Team or not working behind this, it'd still be the same issue</p><p>I guess the timing was a bit messed up re: communications, people like to not keep so many communication lines especially with how many new devs have joined the<a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%24yFi&amp;src=cashtag_click""> $</a>YFI community...</p><p>Andre retweeted the photo then people started to create a conspiracy about surprising everyone.</p><p>Personally I was under that impression too, it's just crypto culture being so twisted, people like puzzles and anonymity, quite to its own detriment but that's my bias.</p><p>Refund wise, it shows that the project will still be continued in good faith.</p><p>It also shows that there is a human touch to all of these high TVL degen actions.</p><p>People risk a lot in general, it doesn't matter what space or asset class.</p><p>You can't fault people for returning an exploiter's funds to those<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/halfrekt?src=hashtag_click""> #halfrekt</a>, just as much as you can't fault the exploiter for returning half the funds in the first place.</p><p>I'm technically not on Andre's level and had a hunch that this could have been rug pulled before going to sleep but really, it was just a whole narrative of chance.</p><p>Everyone just really needs to sleep more.</p></section>"

This has led many to point the blame at Cronje as the cause of their loss.

The first Uniswap <a href=""https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/1"">proposal </a>has failed.<p></p><p>A vote created by Dharma  proposing “<em>a threshold of 3m UNI for proposal submission, and 30m UNI as quorum.”</em>  has been rejected today after failing to meet quorum.
</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pAgagsffIrZb-ZU6U75qvPHXBtiSnsQkOfUboQovSY0Tg_UQ0zAWE7kUndkcK_DvcrEQU5LtMM25o6QCXJ3YvN9Gg3Mrlv1AQ20vPLh85IIXChQen6J4z7OctKNoYnJ5ASRERgNz""/></figure>
This was a controversial move by the founders of <a href=""https://github.com/dharma-eng/dharma-smart-wallet"">Dharma</a>, who claimed that a lower proposal and quorum threshold would increase participation in Uniswap governance.<p></p><p>However if the vote had passed quorum, Dharma, Gauntlet and Univalent would have had total control over the governance of the platform. As the largest <a href=""https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984#balances"">holders </a>of UNI, they would have been able to propose and swing votes in their favour.</p><p>This <a href=""https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmRnJtRXKCx2X89QosbvK4swnQMjkEX9JHCDxcXvBQT1Lm/site.html"">dashboard </a>shows who voted, and for which decision.</p><p>This Dune Analytics <a href=""https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/uniswap-governance"">dashboard</a> shows further details on UNI delegators.</p><p><em>“We propose a threshold of 3m UNI for proposal submission, and 30m UNI as quorum.”</em></p><p>The 30M quorum figure is no coincidence - Dharma has 30m votes, meaning this proposal would allow them to pass whatever they choose.</p><p>Although unlikely, as the identities of the main UNI holders are public, lowering quorum too much can create the possibility for situations like the DAO hack where malicious proposals lost investors millions.</p><p>Many expressed their concern about the negative impact that this vote could have had on the decentralisation of the platform, and on DeFi as a whole had it been successful.</p><p>There is currently around $800M in ETH being used in UNI liquidity mining. If the program ends as planned on November 17th, this $800m will be withdrawn from Uniswap, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/RyanBerckmans/status/1317643405040799747?s=20"">some </a>are concerned that this increases the susceptibility for bad actors to create a flash crash in the price of ETH.</p><p>Creating governance proposals is a fine art, all details should be considered by the reader and the proposer. If multiple changes are desired, multiple proposals are required. Dharma’s Vote 1 proposed two changes to the platform within a single proposal, which is not good practice.</p><p>A change to quorum should be one proposal, and a change to proposal submission should be a separate proposal.</p><p>Although the centralised distribution of UNI tokens causing an imbalance in power is clearly a cause for concern, Stani of Aave makes a good point regarding token delegation.
</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FsXYoIRYQQkgl3oQ4nUOlc8jotDeRAg2fIjZ10FUPoFddepHWGhLr_qfG3XD9wF8Jakqk97k2fFkPjOKjypibELetMyXGvXnYFqouarAgFhUUNPOJz_YbxoPy4BDo0aNmG4RIPNm""/></figure>
This hasn’t prevented many from seeing this vote as a failed attempt to take over the Uniswap platform by one of their main competitors.<p></p><p>The CEO of Dharma has spoken out on this subject…
</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Bzg5e9BdDimyaNx5Dm7r-BWcjFH8sjk2K2zAk08zqjgqX-6yOM0TUCcAzTyKY55cExDmTJ1dkFtRheNmAkp75yuIp08mVZObzxeqmD6hLyu0ecuLFrblSU0GTcw1kdJE3zjlNZ0-""/></figure>
The suspicion regarding Dharma’s motives to pass the vote was increased by the knowledge that Dharma was not happy with the distribution of the UNI token.<p></p><p>Dharma have made their <a href=""https://gov.uniswap.org/t/retroactive-airdrop-excludes-proxy-contract-users-e-g-dharma-matcha-etc/1222"">opinions </a>clear about the UNI distribution, stating that their users were unfairly excluded and the retroactive UNI airdrop should be extended to all wallets that used interfaces that interact with Uniswap, such as Dharma, Matcha, Paraswap etc.</p><p>Not only would this extra distribution benefit their users, but Dharma would stand to benefit greatly from such a move.</p><p>If Uniswap Vote 1 had passed, Dharma would have not only been able to propose a further UNI distribution, but they would have been able to swing the vote in their favour.</p><p>This is a clear example of the potential impact of governance and the power of holding large sums of governance tokens.</p><p>Groups such as the Penguin Party are aiming to protect the decentralisation and sovereignty of Uniswap by implementing <a href=""https://medium.com/@hiturunk/autonomous-proposals-campaign-update-9a9bab56fc30"">Autonomous proposals</a> similar to those used in Compound.</p><p>Access to autonomous proposals would go some way toward preventing this total control of power occurring in the future, as community members would be able to pool their voting power and easily create formal proposals.</p><p>Currently, even well-known groups or individuals might struggle to raise enough UNI to create a proposal, so it appears autonomous proposals are vital for the continued decentralisation of the platform.

Another controversial factor of the debut Uniswap Governance proposal is the fact that many users were prevented from voting due to the following restriction.<p></p><p><strong>Only UNI votes that were self delegated or delegated to another address before block**<strong>11042288*</strong>*are eligible for voting.</strong></p><p>This rule required anyone who wished to vote to have delegated their UNI *before *the proposal was made, an unnecessary restriction which seems to only favour the party who created the proposal, while punishing anyone who is not in favour or had not prepared.</p><p>Snapshotting the delegation in this way is clearly an oversight; at the time the proposal was launched, only 48M total UNI were delegated, and as the required quorum to pass a vote is at least 40M UNI, we can see that Uniswap’s Governance still has some teething problems.</p><p>Many will be relieved with today’s results. Although the vote was not passed, it seems to have been a good learning opportunity, and perhaps served as a good warning of what could happen if a bad actor manages to take control of a platform.</p><p>We may never know if Dharma would have used this opportunity in a dishonest way, perhaps they were just trying to offer some better yield to their users...

it</p><p>anyway i'll give you the token name when everyone is finally out, which 4 months later, is going fucking slowly</p><p>so yeah lesson learned there</p><p>nothing like this would work now as people are like skeptical of everything which is good</p><p>but man you know how it was several months ago</p><p>we were going into shit blind every day lol</p><p>so this was early, and like i said, not mind blowing or anything, but just went the extra mile to make it look legit</p><p>and use a name that people would relate to a premium product</p><p>and be frothing at the mouth so much they couldn't afford to dyor</p><p>which is what happened apparently</p><p>i actually created 3 tokens</p><p>only launched one</p><p>one was FED</p><p>united states federal digital asset token and another was iTOKEN</p><p>apple's ""token""</p><p>the third is the one i launched</p><p>but anyway</p><p>felt horrible doing that</p><p>i got into trouble early on in my late teens</p><p>which involved taking money from people illegally so</p><p>i said i wouldn't do it again, but damn, i fought some demons man</p><p>seeing a new suv sitting there for the taking</p><p>so in a way, it was the ultimate test for me</p><p>but scary to think this has probably happened to people</p><p>well, def happened to people</p><p>yeah, the guilt is the issue i would have had, and i just lay awake at night thinking about shit already, this would have been on my mind every night so thankfully, i didn't execute and take advantage of people though i still cost them gas and missed opportunity i suppose</p><p>so yeah, i'm still a piece of shit</p><p><strong>Did you have an exit planned out before money entered the contract</strong></p><p>believe it or not, i wanted to see if it would work if executed on a more professional level, i thought if it got up to a few eth i'd consider it successful, but wasn't planning on taking money</p><p>when it went up that high</p><p>i'll be honest, i did cash out some, but conscious got the better of me</p><p>and i sold it back</p><p>then i thought about it again, taking everything</p><p>so it was fucking miserable a few nights</p><p>as i just thought about this, tried to justify taking it</p><p>then i'd go back and forth</p><p>well it ended up being a morality litmus test</p><p>when it got up that high, just didn't expect that</p><p><strong>how high?</strong></p><p>Around 75k</p><p><strong>that wouldn't have even made the news at the time, there were so many scams going on</strong></p><p>Def not but it would have changed some people's lives for the worse</p><p>including mine eventually</p><p><strong>what % of your portfolio would that 75k have represented?</strong></p><p>at the time, like 1/2</p><p><strong>a considerable amount for you then.</strong></p><p>well like i said, i would have bought the wife a new car with it, she deserves it so made it even harder</p><p>and honestly, if i hadn't gotten in trouble earlier on in life</p><p>i probably would have done it</p><p>but i just knew the guilt would be impossible to deal with</p><p><strong>what was it about your past experience that deterred you from taking the money this time</strong></p><p>that was something a bit different</p><p>I don’t know if you remember WAREZ? basically ftc fraud and computer crimes 3rd degree,</p><p>ftc fraud is financial transaction card fraud</p><p>credit card fraud</p><p>i was basically buying stolen numbers</p><p>and using them to make purchases at best buy back in the day</p><p>computers</p><p>sending them to vacant houses</p><p>and selling them</p><p><strong>how long did that go on for?</strong></p><p>About a year, before I got extremely greedy, eventually, got caught b/c i missed a delivery, and signed for the package at fed ex</p><p>greed man</p><p>Greed led to a 3rd degree charge for computer crimes</p><p><strong>do you think it was more of a moral dilemma this time rather than a fear of the law?</strong></p><p>back then, legal</p><p>now, moral</p><p>since we're tech in a ""safe space""</p><p>well, safer in that it's extremely anonymous</p><p><strong>what gave you the idea?</strong></p><p><strong>how did you create the tokens?</strong></p><p>i tracked down this channels that released new token launches</p><p>people monitored them including me</p><p>for everyone that was in there</p><p><strong>creating 3 different tokens, that doesn't sound like just an innocent experiment</strong></p><p>well the only reason there were 3 is b/c i fucked up a couple</p><p>in regards to tokens minted etc</p><p>for example, i only minted like 10k tokens the first time</p><p>which wasn't enough</p><p>the second one i somehow put on a diff network</p><p>so didn't set out to make 3</p><p>just kind of fucked 2 up lol</p><p>i used coinmechanic though</p><p>you can do all kinds of stuff there from simple to more sophisticated but this just needed to be a good name with decent liquidity</p><p>that is why i dumped so many eth in there initially</p><p>which i was nervous about for sure</p><p>but yeah i think part of me knew that if this worked, i'd be tempted</p><p>hell i've been tempted about other things since those charges 20 years ago</p><p>but that has always been at the back of my mind</p><p>just the wife</p><p>who yelled at me pretty much</p><p><strong>you told her?</strong></p><p>she reads me pretty well anyway, knew something was bothering me</p><p>she knows about a lot of this stuff but doesn't understand most of it</p><p>she'll ask me how yfi is doing shit like that</p><p><strong>don't ask 😅</strong></p><p>ha not lately yeah</p><p>i mean i told her what i told you basically in a lot less detail</p><p>not that i was hiding it, just didn't matter</p><p>but yeah, wasn't happy</p><p>just kind of gave m the disappointed glance and asked why</p><p>which cut deep</p><p><strong>I can imagine.</strong></p><p><strong>so the money was sitting there and you said you could take it if you wanted</strong></p><p>so yeah i minted a shitload of tokens and basically set the price</p><p>so when the money went in, i would have just dumped the tokens i was holding</p><p>but also what was interesting is</p><p>i was watching it</p><p>you would see people, the same person</p><p>put money in</p><p>and then either realize something wasn't right, or change their mind or whatever</p><p>and pull it out like 3 mins, 10 mins, however much longer later</p><p>same address, same amount</p><p>the largest transaction was about 10k</p><p><strong>what was the average deposit?</strong></p><p>if i had to guess, a few hundred bucks</p><p><strong>that must have added to the guilt</strong></p><p>which is crazy when you think about it</p><p>b/c that many people fomo'd into this thing</p><p>and you know 200 bucks was a lot to some of these people at the very least so</p><p><strong>what did you do to make the coin seem legitimate?</strong></p><p><strong>are the websites still up?</strong></p><p>honestly, i don't know that these people even visited the website</p><p>but, did the telegram discord links, fake twitter posts</p><p>fake staking pools that were ""coming soon""</p><p>fake white paper with names changed</p><p>and fake audits</p><p><strong>anonymous devs?</strong></p><p>ha def</p><p>anyone that knew anything would immediately have known it was a scam i'm sure</p><p>but imagine 4 or 5 months ago</p><p>thinking for example the US had their own token that was coming out soon</p><p><strong>can you send a link to one of them?</strong></p><p>let me see if i can find FED</p><p>shit my timeline is off, says this was 60 days ago</p><p><strong>defi time</strong></p><p>so this token was still tech created</p><p>so people went into it lol</p><p>but i left it, never pulled anything out etc</p><p><a

<strong>The feast of DeFi summer is over.</strong> The food tokens have gone cold, and much of what’s coming out of the kitchen seems stale and unappealing.<p></p><p>Now is the time to take a look at what is left on our plate, adjust our belts, and perhaps reconsider our diet for the next few months.</p><p>Some form of market correction was to be expected after the gluttony and irrational exuberance of the summer. There is always a bigger fish in the sea, those who considered themselves whales have turned out to be plankton: nothing but yield for the real alpha hunters.</p><p>A new mindset is required to survive now that winter is coming - we must all adapt to a more sustainable way of farming, and hold back our greed for the betterment of DeFi as a whole.</p><p>However, some gems remain amongst the rotten food, and we should now consider how we can assess their worth.</p><p><strong>A new mindset is emerging</strong></p><p>Although still the preferred model of analysis of many on crypto Twitter, now that so many tokens have some inherent value through yield generation, investing in cryptocurrency tokens is not as simple as “price go up = good, price go down = bad”.</p><p>The rise of staking models and application of game theory in governance models has added a nuance to tokenomics that didn’t previously exist.</p><p>To assess the value of tokens in a post-yield farming era, some are using a price to earnings ratio, where the current token price is divided by the annual earnings granted per token.</p><p>Is this TradFi technique applicable to DeFi? If an asset is purchased with ETH or another cryptocurrency, is calculating P/E in USD the best we can do?</p><p>In the past, other methods were proposed, such as the NVT ratio - Network Value to Transactions, which was useful before the rise of yield generating tokens, as we could use the data from money flowing through the network as a proxy to earnings <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/wwoo/2017/09/29/is-bitcoin-in-a-bubble-check-the-nvt-ratio/#43611dfb6a23"">[1]</a>. However, to use NVT on an asset such as YFI, UNI, veCRV, or SNX would be incorrect, as they operate in an entirely different way.</p><p><strong>The case for AMM</strong></p><p><em>1 - Uniswap</em></p><p>Uniswap’s UNI <a href=""https://uniswap.org/blog/uni/"">tokenomics</a> are one to watch; once the Uniswap governance gets control of the treasury on October 17th, we could see some unprecedented levels of community interaction, as UNI holders will be able to vote on allocating grants, public goods funding, and more, all of which should serve to bolster the growth of the industry.</p><p>As the DeFi industry grows, it is likely that the Uniswap trading volume will increase, and if governance acts as expected and chooses to send trading fees to the users, then UNI holders would be well <a href=""https://gov.uniswap.org/t/poll-how-would-we-structure-a-fee-reward/5790"">rewarded</a>.</p><p>Consider the potential of being able to trade any token using a non-custodial solution, once the current disadvantages such as gas price are resolved, which are excluding a good amount of retail traders and slowing down adoption.</p><p><em>2 - Curve</em></p><p>Like Uniswap, Curve doesn’t rely on other protocols to generate its yield, so we can use our predictions on the trade volume of Curve to create an estimated yield %.</p><p>veCRV (vote locked CRV), will soon start distributing a percentage of the protocol’s fees to those who lock their CRV rewards. The admin fee, or “governance incentive” that will be distributed would currently give veCRV a P/E ratio of 1.205. (For context, the P/E ratio of the S&amp;P500 is 22.2, although this is clearly not a direct comparison, as one is locked for 4 years and the other is not.)</p><p>veCRV yield and thus its P/E ratio is proportional to:</p><ul><li>Curve trading volume</li><li>veCRV supply</li><li>CRV price</li></ul><p>The market does not seem to currently value the large yield of veCRV, possibly because it is worried that there will be a large increase in veCRV supply (more CRV being locked, which would reduce the yield per veCRV) which would reduce the appeal of having locked CRV for several years.</p><p>However, as long as the trading volume on Curve increases at a similar rate to the CRV-&gt;veCRV locking rate, then the veCRV yield shouldn’t drop too much. Even if the veCRV yield stabilises at what could seem like a paltry 20% APY, then the interests accrued over 4 years would leave the staker with their original CRV balance plus approximately the value of their initial CRV generated in yield over 4 years.</p><p>The market therefore seems to be signaling that Curve will be irrelevant within 4 years, that the majority of CRV yield farmers either have not understood this dynamic, or that they simply prefer short term gains over larger long term profits.

Buying SNX simply to hold it would be comparable to having a beautiful car that you never use. It may appreciate in value, but you would never have the pleasure of using it.</p><p>SNX has a great deal to offer, and those who have simply held in the past would benefit from experimenting with its range of features via sBTC, sETH and sDEFI.</p><p>The SNX <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a5r9aFP5bh6wGG4-HIW2MWPf4yMthZvesZOurnG-v_8/edit#gid=0"">inflation schedule</a> is one example of <a href=""https://blog.synthetix.io/reaching-monetary-policy-consensus/"">community led</a> decisions being perfectly executed.

<strong>YFI, a proxy trade for DeFi yield?</strong><p></p><p>At the time of writing, 1 YFI provides the holder with an annual return of ~<a href=""https://yearn.finance/vaults"">5%</a>, which although considerably lower than it once was, is still impressive, as it is an income generated directly from the YFI tokenomics, with the TVL of the vault being used to farm other tokens, and the 5% gas subsidy fee and 0.5% withdrawal fee for vault users is returned to those within the vault.
</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jzWIOd1yx1nYkQVKQaPAaGHzb3aqdKphLDUHbbZgr1osO7oMvJCfM2GVQOMCaQwPPIMet71ggn4URplQ70ae8_R7yEabhD4bFtVeG7mN4N8C6TtLbsJU9eruFUOii1RC8KaYr3jw""/></figure>
As YFI is so reliant on the price of other tokens to generate yield for its users, serves as a proxy trade tool for the overall health of DeFi, as the YFI price will rise and fall depending on the tokens it feeds from (CRV now, UNI .soon).<p></p><p>Around the ATH of YFI, some were calling for a token price of $500,000. Now that the price is down ~65%, and currently trading around $15,000, the sentiment seems to have changed somewhat.

As we can currently achieve a higher yield % using stable coins than with an asset like YFI, will our appetite for purchasing more volatile yield generating tokens decrease?<p></p><p>Although YFIs meteoric rise in price captured the attention of many, it is not the only yield generating model out there. Many other tokens, old and new, promise some type of return to the holder.</p><p>As YFI generates yield for its users by farming other tokens; to make % yield estimates, we would need to estimate the price of the tokens being farmed. Because of these tokenomics and the current farming model, it’s fair to say that the YFI price is derived from, or at least closely linked to, the price of the tokens it farms.</p><p><strong>Some further thoughts on DeFi trading</strong></p><p>The fact that some of the DeFi protocols are entirely controlled by governance means it is impossible for them to release a roadmap - for better or for worse, the community controls how the protocols operate. This introduces an unprecedented level of unpredictability, and creates a wealth of opportunity for those with large holdings of governance tokens and an understanding of game theory.</p><p>The <a href=""https://gov.yearn.finance/"">YFI</a>, <a href=""https://gov.curve.fi/"">CRV</a>, <a href=""https://research.synthetix.io/"">SNX</a>, and <a href=""https://gov.uniswap.org/"">UNI </a>governance forums are a hive of activity where keen users who can see the potential in the platform are eagerly discussing ways to maximise the profits and efficiency of each protocol. This is decentralisation in action, and the constant changes and updates are fascinating to watch.</p><p>There are a few values that we should consider in order to assess the sustainability of a tokenomics model:</p><ul><li>What is the fully diluted market cap, and when is that dilution expected to be complete (i.e. the inflation rate). The 4 year inflation schedules of the UNI and CRV tokens are receiving a great deal of criticism, and have been branded as “death by emission” by some. However when compared to the monetary base of BTC, we can see they are not dissimilar.</li></ul><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2020/10/inflation3.png""/></figure>BTC - CRV - UNI<p></p><ul><li>Take a close look at the tokenomics - is there some cashflow to be expected?</li><li>Consider the implementation of the tokenomics - why have they been executed in this way? How could they be manipulated and how do you think rational people would act within the model?</li><li>Is the token worth purchasing, or just farming?</li><li>We should look at the distribution in the early days - how liquid is the token?</li><li>How many tokens are vested, and to whom?</li></ul><p>Vested tokens can be a blessing and a curse, as although vested tokens can create high volatility in the fragile early stages of a token's life cycle, they also tend to accelerate the process of price discovery, an important stage for any asset.</p><p>Long-term token distribution will dampen the impact of mercenary yield farmers, while keeping an incentive for future liquidity providers, which is vital for the growth of the industry.</p><p>Although inevitable, this market correction was likely accelerated by the glut of valueless food tokens that arrived onto the market and caused so many to get rekt due to their greed or lack of experience.</p><p>We should not dismiss those who are new to the space, if we are to keep profits flowing, we need more people to enter the industry, so let's save them a seat at the table.</p><p>Bring on sustainable farming; community driven tokenomics models which provide profit for the token holder, and also benefit the community as a whole.</p></section>"

<strong>Consensus isn’t just about agreement, it’s about changing things around.</strong><p></p><p>There were problems across the Ethereum network today as consensus flaws were hit on mainnet.</p><p>Services running older versions of geth nodes found themselves stuck on a minority chain, creating a knock-on effect for all apps that were reliant on them.</p><p>Most users learnt of the issue when the Infura API went down. Infura is the largest node provider on the Ethereum network, they provide tools and infrastructure to some of the most commonly used Web 3.0 apps and CEXs, such as Metamask, Uniswap and Binance.</p><p>The service degradation of Infura revealed that Binance either relies on Infura or is running outdated nodes, neither of which are appropriate for such a large exchange.</p><p>Although it may seem odd that Infura was not running the latest <a href=""https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/"">geth</a> versions, it makes sense that such a large scale operator would not be moving straight onto the latest version, as without a hard fork, there’s no urgent reason to switch from a stable working code to an unknown one.

<strong>Humans have long been fascinated by uncertain outcomes.</strong><p></p><p>Since before history was written, we have looked for insight and entertainment in predicting that which we cannot know.</p><p>Technological advancements have improved the art of prediction, however, when looking into the future, some level of uncertainty will always remain.</p><p>Locked down by COVID, we become painfully aware of the power of statistics. We live our lives according to the judgement of algorithms created by unelected developers.</p><p>The modern statistics industry thrives on a constant demand for knowledge of what comes next. Gamblers, politicians, and professionals from all fields benefit from an informed analysis of future events, and a variety of methods have been developed in an attempt to provide such insight.

<strong>Prediction Markets</strong> use money as an incentive to measure the conviction of the public.<p></p><p>Despite providing the perfect environment for the use and creation of prediction markets, no decentralised prediction market platform has achieved true mainstream adoption, and all new platforms struggle to acquire a good depth of liquidity.</p><p>The first decentralised prediction market platform; <a href=""https://augur.net/""><em>Augur</em></a>, took three years to launch after it’s fundraising round in 2014, and although they gained some traction during the 2018 US midterm elections, they have yet to match the volume or liquidity of their centralised counterparts.</p><p>In 2020, most political speculation trading takes place on centralised marketplaces such as FTX or PredictIt. <a href=""https://predictions.global/dashboard"">This </a>is an interesting real-time dashboard showing the status of PredictIt markets.</p><p><a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=us-election-2020&amp;view=market"">Coingecko </a>provides a dashboard showing the top US election 2020 coins by market capitalisation.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2020/11/coingecko.png""/></figure><p></p><p>As we await the outcome of one of the most polemic elections in living memory, on <a href=""https://polymarket.com/market/will-trump-win-the-2020-us-presidential-election"">polymarket.com</a>, over $3 million has been wagered on the answer to the question <em>“Will Trump win the 2020 U.S. presidential election?”</em> To which the answer has been “No” since trading began on October 10th.</p><p><a href=""https://ftx.com/en/trade/TRUMP"">FTX </a>(centralised) and <a href=""https://polymarket.com/market/will-trump-win-the-2020-us-presidential-election"">Polymarket </a>(decentralised) are two crypto-based prediction markets offering odds on the results of the presidential election, which both currently put his chances of victory at around 37.8%.</p><p>Strangely, this is higher than the chances given to a Trump victory by traditional markets and statisticians, where Trump’s chances are between 4 - 14%.</p><p>There are several possible reasons for this differing prediction; Vitalik Buterin took to Twitter to express his opinions of how such a disparity could emerge.</p><p>In his ""pro-prediction market"" view, Buterin suggests that these novel markets</p><blockquote><p>""Correctly incorporate <em>the possibility of heightened election meddling, voter suppression, etc. affecting the outcome.</em>” whereas traditional statistical models <em>“just assume the voting process is fair.”</em></p><p>In contrast, Buterin’s “pro-statistics model” makes the following point;</p><p>""Prediction markets are difficult to access for statistical / politics experts, <em>they're too small for hedge funds to hire those experts, and the people (esp wealthy people) with the most access to PMs are more optimistic about Trump.”</em></p></blockquote><p>He goes on to dismiss an <em>“unlikely”</em> third possibility, that <em>“the experts"" are incorrigibly dumb and just haven't learned their lessons around detecting surprise pro-Trump voters”</em></p><p>After years of development, statistician Nate Silver has today ended his election forecast with the following<a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/final-2020-presidential-election-forecast/""> prediction: </a></p><blockquote><p><em>Joe Biden is favored to beat President Trump (though Trump still has a 1-in-10 chance); Democrats have a 3-in-4 shot at taking back the Senate; and the House will most likely remain under Democratic control (Democrats might even expand their majority by a few seats).</em></p></blockquote><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2020/11/casino-interior-nouveauBW.jpg""/></figure>
<strong>Political vs Prediction</strong><p></p><p>Are political polls less efficient than prediction markets? Markets are certainly useful for unearthing material non-public information.</p><p>Imagine an event where some people know the winner but the public does not. Once the prize gets big enough, eventually someone would bet with their inside knowledge and the market would move. <a href=""https://twitter.com/jdh/status/1323481792305721344?s=20"">(@jdh)</a>.</p><p>However, nobody knows how this election will end. There is very little inside information that can be extracted by the incentives of the market.</p><p><strong>For now,</strong> it seems statisticians have the edge over the prediction market. However, they were proven wrong in 2016, and it could happen again. In the future, as prediction markets grow and blockchain technology is more widely used, the wallet of the hivemind might offer wiser insight than even our best statistician.</p><p><strong>DeFi under Biden vs Trump</strong></p><p>Some are of the opinion that a Biden victory would bring about greater mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, including potential approval of an ETF.</p><blockquote><p><em>A potential Joe Biden presidency should shine favor on further appreciation in the price of Bitcoin, in our view. New leadership may change the hands-off policy of the Trump administration — to the detriment of the broader crypto market — and nudge the firstborn benchmark toward the mainstream, improving chances for an ETF.</em></p></blockquote><p>However, a recent Bloomberg crypto newsletter referred to the Trump administration’s crypto policies as being <em>“hands-off”</em>.</p><p>Is a “hands-off” approach preferable for the industry right now?</p><p>Isolation from regulatory invaders could be beneficial for the space as our new species of financial flora and fauna grows and evolves without interference.</p><p>If an administration is good for Bitcoin, is it good for DeFi? The two sectors seem to be drifting apart, and although major players are accumulating BTC like never before, DeFi is still seen as dangerous and unexplored territory.</p><p><strong>If prediction is the foundation of intelligence</strong>, then memories are the blocks with which it’s built. Large datasets are food for the artificial intelligentsia, who form detailed images of a future invisible to the human eye.</p><p>We are living in the information age, where data is power. Whatever the outcome of this election, during the next four years, the president elect will be forced to confront the growing demand for alternative currencies.</p><p>In a year of scarcity for the sports gambler, cryptocurrency based prediction markets have provided an accessible and entertaining event for speculation.</p><p>As volume grows, and mass adoption is achieved, these markets will provide much more than entertainment, as the conviction of gamblers and politically minded traders produces yet more data which we feed to our AI, and so the cycle continues...</p><p>Art from <a href=""https://www.artpad.org/"">https://www.artpad.org</a> &amp; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_to_Come"">Things to Come - 1936</a></p></section>"

With shrewd investments from industry leaders, innovative development continues, the cycle of change becomes tighter, and technological advancements accelerate.</p><p>A new economy will arise, self-started careers will flourish, and increased remote working combined with globalised currencies will begin to level the playing field, as a technological meritocracy becomes the economic standard.</p><p>The altruistic applications of Web 3.0 will change the public perception of charity, and matured DAOs will become household names as non-governmental organisations are today.</p><p>However, not all DAO activity will win the approval of the public.</p><p>Governance protocol wars will scale drastically, and as the battle for power between banks, big tech and governments becomes more aggressive, we will see complex game theory being utilised as a weapon to manipulate not just protocols, but entire democracies.</p><p>The tension between the US, China and the EU will escalate, and decentralised currencies increase instability as countries lose control of their printing machines. China tokenises CNY and issues it on-chain, forcing the US to adapt, or get left behind.</p><p>Governments will be forced to incentivise their citizens to use their native currency over the decentralised alternative. Some will enforce this by law, while others will take a more liberal approach, but an alternative global economy will develop regardless.</p><p>During this radical transition, some citizens will suffer while their neighbours prosper, as different leaders take their own approach to regulation and apply different limitations upon their people. Those who allow for total financial freedom still face dangers, as the unexpecting public become exposed to the experienced hackers and slick arbitrageurs of the decentralised underworld.</p><p>Nations will not only be forced to create and adapt to an on-chain economy in their own country, but they will have to learn to defend themselves from interference from attacking states, who try to disrupt and influence their politics by any means necessary.</p><p>Certain governments will restrict or eliminate tools of the industry which are exposed to regulation, such as stablecoins or centralised exchanges. Users of Coinbase or Tether are at the mercy of the corporations who own them, and ultimately the governments who regulate said corporations.

<strong>A Tokenised World</strong><p></p><p>Unfortunately, tribalism never fades away entirely. Conflict-loving maximalists will always try to smear the work of others, but as cross chain interoperability and tokenisation becomes more common,the arguments will become less passionate.</p><p>The quantity of BTC on the Ethereum network started to increase rapidly in 2020. By Q3 it had increased by over 13,000%, from 1,109 wrapped Bitcoins in January, to 150,970 in late October.</p><p>2020 will be remembered as the tipping point for tokenisation, not just of BTC, but of real-world assets, as FTX offered trading of tokenised Tesla shares on-chain for the first time.</p><p>The ability to tokenise our physical assets will likely result in financial ruin for less disciplined gamblers, as they become able to use their real-world assets as on-chain collateral.</p><p>Court cases will be opened in the hundreds or thousands as the prices of private company stocks are copied onto the blockchain allowing speculators to trade the volatility in a mirrored financial market that pays nothing to the middleman.</p><p><a href=""https://bitcointreasuries.org/"">Bitcoin treasuries</a> in publicly traded companies will continue to grow, with Square’s purchase of <strong>“approximately 4,709 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $50 million”</strong> being one of the most eye-catching announcements of this kind in 2020.</p><p>With an economic environment prime for inflation, Jack Dorsey saw a growing role for Bitcoin, and he was not alone in doing so.</p><p>When publicly traded companies purchase BTC, it is a treasury management decision, not speculation. Post 2020, having some % of the company treasury in BTC becomes a common promotional narrative, encouraging other businesses to invest for the publicity as well as the potential profit.</p><p>Misleading headlines such as <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/uk-listed-firm-mode-putting-10-of-cash-reserves-into-bitcoin"">“UK-Listed Firm Mode Putting Up to 10% of Cash Reserves Into Bitcoin”</a>, are one such example of companies recognising the promotional value of associating themselves with cryptocurrency, as their headline turns out to refer to a purchase of <a href=""https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/MODE/interim-results-for-the-period-ended-30-june-2020/14716173"">only 6.7 BTC.</a></p><p>“Learning in public” will become a widely recognised form of career progression, and numerically minded auto-didacts will thrive. As the multimillion dollar hacks and exploits that are so common in cryptocurrency start to reach the mainstream news, ambitious students willing to bend the rules will start to choose computer science and software development over accounting or business studies.</p><p>However, white hat hackers will also be in high demand, and as hacking or exploiting becomes harder over time, and new standards and best practices emerge, the safety of the entire industry will improve.</p><p>Multiple billion dollar companies will be founded by small teams of young developers working from only a laptop, and thus the balance of power will shift.</p><p>The non-stop globalised nature of this new open financial industry will encourage companies to geographically diversify their workforces, and skills or experience will be valued over qualifications.</p><p>COVID-19 has a lasting impact on the global economy, and some industries never recover.</p><p>Some jobs will be lost to the new technology, as wherever profitable, the inefficient human employee will be replaced by a sophisticated smart contract or well trained AI. A human employee is costly and unpredictable, but code operates as instructed. This role replacement won’t necessarily result in a net loss to employment, an equal number of jobs could be created, as has happened in the previous four revolutions.</p><p>The DeFi market cap may fall; it may even drop by 80% or more, but the best projects will inevitably come back stronger. Eventually banks will race to use DeFi, if not for the yield, then merely for the savings on their daily transactions.</p><p>When the first western high street bank begins to offer DeFi level interest rates to their customers, the floodgates will truly open, and all banks will implement the technology, shaking up local councils and governments across the world.</p><p>Decentralisation will be measured on a spectrum, with full DeFi providing little to no safety net in the form of customer service, or refunds, and their centralised counterparts providing a more familiar, safer space, but with less flexibility and control over the users funds.

The cost of transactions must decrease and TPS must increase, but it is only a matter of time before this happens, and when it does, the opportunity is gone.</p><p>A world based on maths, code, and binary liquidation is not for everyone, and watered down aspects of DeFi will be provided for those who are uncomfortable with barebacking smart contracts via Etherscan.</p><p>Centralised entities will remain for those who are uncomfortable with the risks and responsibility of owning your own private keys, and the spectrum of DeFi will expand to cover the entire financial system.</p><p><strong>The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.</strong></p><p>We must focus on the trend rather than the short term volatility.

If you fell off a bike and scraped your knee, would you get rid of the bike to avoid future injuries despite the benefits of convenience and fitness?<p></p><p>If your partner cheated on you, would you avoid dating for the rest of your life despite the benefits of physical and mental companionship?</p><p>When an airplane crashes, do you ban the aviation industry despite the benefits of mass transit?</p><p>You wouldn't. You take it as a learning experience in order to mitigate the same mistakes from occurring while continuing to leverage the vast opportunities they offer.</p><p><strong>Which is where I disagree with a lot of the ""flash loans are bad"" narratives.</strong></p><p><strong>The Stigma</strong></p><p>I'll admit, when people hear flash loans they inevitably think whale-sized arbitrages and exploits. The latter is ever so prominent because it’s such a common occurrence, and in most cases the two are inexplicably intertwined.</p><p>Generally speaking, when you execute a successful arbitrage you're helping to optimize the DeFi ecosystem by bringing pricing equilibrium across different markets for a particular asset. When you execute a flash loan powered arbitrage via automated bots you're essentially optimizing the ecosystem at scale.</p><p><strong>The concept of Flash Loan Arbing is not a sin and should never be held in such regard.</strong></p><p>For example, while the Victorian Age is often celebrated for sweeping progress and industrial ingenuity in 19th Century Britain (think railways, civic architecture...etc), it was also responsible for extreme social unrest by inadvertently incentivizing all manner of working class people to converge upon the key manufacturing hubs. So it was no surprise organized crime flourished under a melting pot of poverty and overcrowding in those areas. The dwindling of opportunities forced pickpockets to become muggers and muggers to become worse.</p><p><strong>In traditional finance, big VC hedge funds behave in the same way as coders do with flash loans.</strong></p><p>Flash loans simply give short term access to large amounts of capital, all attacks done with flash loans could already be done without.</p><p><strong>Flash loans, for better or worse, have incentivized a melting pot of talented coders of all manner of ethical fluidness to seek out untold fortunes.</strong></p><p>In a DeFi space where opportunities have been limited by bots, front runners, back runners, insider telegram groups and MEVs, it is no surprise some (miners included) have used their talent for nefarious purposes in order to earn a crust.</p><p>The limited opportunities turned some white hats into grey hats, and grey hats into black hats. The raft of flash loan powered exploits since the beginning of this year are well documented, so I won't bore you in revisiting them. But what I will do is unequivocally (albeit controversially) emphasize that <strong>this is a good thing.</strong></p><p><strong>The Crucible of Fire</strong></p><p>Even while the Value <em>(Akropolis + Origin + Cheesebank)</em> exploit is unfolding as I write this, I firmly believe this is the evolutionary journey the DeFi space needs to traverse in order to mature into a sustainable ecosystem.</p><p>The process of weeding out weak projects make DeFi more secure in the long run because you're left with battle hardened systems that stood the test of time.Think back to how many questionable ERC20 projects that were launching ICOs at the height of the 2017 hysteria - their growth and architectural validity were unchecked and inevitably unsustainable. Fast forward to 2020 and the DeFi boom brought about a similar level of growth in *.finance projects, except this time within the permissionless composability of the DeFI landscape, they are constantly tested by actors of all various coloured hats.</p><p><strong>Flash Loans enable attack vectors to be exposed earlier,</strong> which forces projects to constantly adapt and keep security at the forefront of their minds.</p><p><strong>Those who don't learn from history, perish.</strong> Those who do, become all the better for it. Of course, not all exploited projects can heal as easily as a scraped knee from a bicycle fall, but you certainly can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.</p><p>A recent Twitter interaction by users Fiona Kobayashi and Alex Svanevik sums up this sentiment well:
</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HhbiRxCTYHawz55Axzs9IE7QZ36ydcWk6ws-p7uyjJ0wy09qz3Bpdn7tG-jsXQoY6VjdJWpBcs-tSA--2PfIvmjbBx-Mi5CXF9ZCPgJe3ofrGbV_GLPXIxmHB69RxJL362U4Qtzu""/></figure>
<strong>Not just Arbs and Unicorns</strong><p></p><p>Then there are the other benefits of Flash Loans that are well documented but are often overlooked in debates about the validity of flash loans. If you genuinely looked into the broad ranging benefits of Flash Loans, and not just reading up on the latest flash arb attacks via a blog, you'll realise it is significantly a net positive for the DeFi landscape as a whole.</p><p>In cases where a user's underlying collateral is nose diving in value, a Flash Loan powered Self Liquidation can help users fend off the threat of liquidation by flash repaying the debt, swapping the collateral into the debt token and then using it to repay the flash loan, all at the cost of 9bps + gas rather than the ~13% liquidation penalty. In a similar context, Flash Loan Collateral Swaps allow you to swap out an underperforming collateral with one that is appreciating in value, all without the hassle of manually closing your CDP or sourcing additional capital. You can even flash refinance by migrating your loan from one protocol to another.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5vTzP6hrXR2eUIo1H-USagqXAnGO7MPf5YZtwTDxizfrehAjJElAoOHHmjFpmlZXfTI6xj82o2bSIt43kVPAFJhLMX1Af7hL9uk8SlmVgQjgg527sYCGba-hBfA4KLsegprPx2F3""/></figure>
Flash Loans are also an ubiquitous DeFi trait that captures interest from TradFi and CeFi alike. When combined with user friendly tools like Furucombo and DefiSaver which abstracts away the architectural complexities for the user and levels the financial playing field for everyone.<p></p><p>Flash Loans is easily one of the key differentiators in supporting mainstream adoption.</p><p>Therefore we need to take a balanced approach to evaluating whether something is good or bad for the DeFi space.</p><p>The coexistence and balancing of the two perspectives in historical society is, incidentally, known as the ""Victorian Compromise"".</p><hr/><p><strong>Editor's Note</strong></p><p>Since their creation, cryptocurrencies have fundamentally challenged the global financial framework. Stablecoins turn this challenge into a direct threat, as their familiarity to the user alongside their obvious benefits creates a seemingly unstoppable competitor to the existing system.</p><p>As the effects of the pandemic shrink bank interest rates to zero or below, the steady 10%+ rates available on the digital dollar are starting to catch the eye of traditional finance.</p><p>Yet the dollar is only the starting point. As more governments accept the inevitable digitisation of money, more stablecoins will be released, pegged to different global currencies.</p><p>The Euro, the Yuan, and the Ruble will all be represented on-chain, reducing the current FX risk that comes with our current reliance on the digital dollar.</p><p>As nations release their own official blockchain based currencies, anonymous entities will do the same, and users will be able to choose between the official digital euro, or a mirrored version with more financial sovereignty.</p><p>The inevitable conflicts with law and tax requirements will be dismissed by a decentralised system, leaving governments struggling to regulate an abstract digital concept.</p><p>Official government currencies will flow in the same stream as their anonymous decentralised counterpart, and people will switch between the two as they please.</p><p>Flash loans are one of the most unique concepts of DeFi, and stablecoins are the perfect tool to maximise their impact.</p><p><strong>The biggest financial applications of the future are emerging now, and they’re built for stablecoins.</strong></p></section>"

Coinbase Oracle has had “issues” in the past, which always seem to lead to highly profitable situations for certain actors.<p></p><p>Whether this was a manipulation or a technical issue isn’t yet clear, but we do know that no flash loans were used.

<strong>Solidity.Finance: The Official Statement</strong><p></p><blockquote><p><em>The Compounder team swapped the safe/audited Strategy contracts and replaced them with malicious 'Evil Strategy' contracts that allowed them to steal users funds.

The attacker gained access to the US government's internal Microsoft Office 365 platform via software updates from the IT company SolarWinds.</p><p>During this time the cybersecurity firm <a href=""https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html"">FireEye </a>has also been targeted, leading them to release the following statement.</p><blockquote><p><em>Consistent with a nation-state cyber-espionage effort, the attacker primarily sought information related to certain government customers.

We develop proprietary machine learning based technologies to automate the creation and distribution of adult entertainment content, or in layman's terms we are building AIs to create porn. A large part of that involves working with deepfake technologies, and specifically how to insert AI generated people into videos in a photorealistic fashion through deepfakes.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Can you tell us about your work in AI before you merged it with crypto?</em></p><p><strong>IE:</strong></p><p>Our team has over a decade’s experience in machine learning and computer vision working across all industries but primarily developing solutions for large scale agriculture and pharmaceuticals.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Regarding the DeTrade video - what were your thoughts when you watched it for the first time?</em></p><p><strong>IE:</strong></p><p>There was a lot of speculation that it is “AI generated” or a deepfake, or both. I’ve looked it over a few times now and while it’s possible it is a deepfake of a real person, <strong>the person in the video is almost certainly not AI generated</strong>. I think it’s important to understand the difference between these two technologies.</p><p>We at REDACTED have trained a GAN to generate our own people who do not exist. That is something fundamentally different from a “deepfake”.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Please can you explain the difference between AI generated and deepfake?</em></p><p><strong>IE:</strong></p><p>Well to be clear, deepfake technologies do use AI. However deepfakes as a technology do not involve training an AI to create a new persona. Instead deepfakes take an already existing set of data of a person's face, and overlay it on top of another person's face in an already existing video. If done right what you should get is a photorealistic and convincing ""faceswap"" where you have a video of a person doing something they did not in fact do. So in sum, <strong>deepfakes do not create a new person at all, but rather involve overlaying an already existing face into another video.</strong></p><p>On the other hand an ""AI generated person"" whether that person is represented as a video or a still image, involves an entirely separate kind of machine learning in which a large amount of data showing photos of different people are given to an AI (usually a Generative Adversarial Network or 'GAN') so that the AI begins to understand what a 'person' or a 'body' is. Once it has enough of this data, the AI can generate new iterations of people based on the data that it has already been shown. So this kind of AI is the exact opposite of deepfakes in terms of our current conversation, it cannot be used to insert a person into video but it can create new people out of thin air.</p><p><strong>What I saw regarding DeTrade were accusations that the person in the video was AI generated, and possibly also deepfaked over an existing video of another person. I want to be clear that this is almost certainly not the case.</strong></p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>What makes you so sure?</em></p><p><strong>IE:</strong></p><p>It's a matter of capabilities. <strong>There are maybe 5 or so companies in the world who can generate a new photo realistic person from nothing with an AI and then can also insert that person into an existing video like the one we saw</strong>, to that degree of realism. I should know, we are one of those 5 companies. The others are all multi-billion dollar tech companies like Nvidia, or highly reputable AI startups with tens of millions of dollars in funding. The likelihood that c-suite execs at Nvidia are taking time out of their schedules to scam the DeFi community for a few million bucks seems very slim to me.</p><p>To be clear on this point, there are tons of people who could have taken the face you saw in that video from a video of a real person. Maybe a teacher giving a zoom class or something.</p><p>But <strong>the idea it's an AI generated face is nearly impossible.</strong></p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>AI and deepfakes seem to be the perfect tool to increase paranoia, and many will think they do more harm than good, how would you respond to that?</em></p><p><strong>IE:</strong></p><blockquote><p><strong>I think frankly speaking, it's appropriate to be paranoid.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>I think everyone needs to get used to the idea that just because you see a photo, or video, or audio of a person, it does not mean that person was really the one in the video or that the person even really exists.</strong></p><p>Lots of people understand this intellectually, but then at the same time are looking for things like ""non-anon teams"" as if seeing a guy give a livestream or show a picture of himself with an ID provides them some extra layer of protection in their investment. This is not really the case.</p><p>Right now there are very few places where someone can spin a new person out of whole cloth and create a video of them. I'm proud to count our company as one of those places. But over time, these technologies always get easier and easier for amateur hobbyists or even organized scammers to replicate, and we are rapidly approaching that point.</p><p>It's as simple as taking into account the fact that <strong>without meeting someone face to face, you are never going to be able to know if they are real, or if the video you saw of them doing something was actually them or just a fake.</strong> In my opinion we are already at that point, and the proliferation of this technology makes it a guarantee that holding to this kind of philosophy will be more and more important as time goes on.</p><blockquote><p><strong>If you didn't shake their hand, you can't be certain someone exists. And if you didn't hold their ID card, you can't be sure their ID does either.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2020/12/image-3.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>In the information age, when we rely so much on the accuracy of the media, we can no longer trust what we see or hear.</strong></p><p>Innovation has always had its <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism"">enemies</a>; will our opinions of this technology change over time?</p><p>Perhaps in twenty years, we will realise our aversion to deepfakes was simply a case of <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/weve-never-feared-tech-as-much-as-we-think-we-have/"">technophobia</a>, and that the societal good outweighs the bad.

It depends what you call the experiment. The Rug Pull wasn't just the auction and subsequent NFT game, it was the whole piece with the build up and the transmedia journey around the idea of greed and trust.</p><p>But there's no doubt, the way the Bitcoin was eventually claimed felt like a damp and premature ending to what we had planned.</p><p>The game was about exerting pressure on the participants and forcing them to confront their own greed mechanics. What happened was one of the 12 owners sold their NFT for a small profit and broke the admittedly tenuous circle of trust that had been built. What this proved was simply what we already know, chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p><p>In this case it didn't take much for someone to take the money and run. I had raised this dynamic in the original promo video. How much can you really trust the other owners of the NFTs. The best outcome is to work together. But I would have loved to see much more pressure from Bitcoin to make it really come alive.</p><p>So, not unhappy but definitely feel like there was more life in this. However, we did ultimately answer the question of what's worth more: the art or the crypto contained within it. In this instance, the crypto was a greater prize. Which is sad but not unexpected.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>When Rstudios removed the bitcoin from the NFT, they were able to do so without anyone knowing.</em></p><p><em>If they hadn’t announced that they had removed the bitcoin, what would have happened?</em></p><p><strong><em>Robin:</em></strong></p><p>It's a good question.</p><p>We're lucky that hackers can be quite vain and like people to know how clever they were.</p><p>To be clear I didn't code the contracts and I didn't engineer the mechanics. I can dream it but we can only work within the parameters of the network.</p><p>I haven't answered your question.</p><p>Probably nothing would have happened until the NFT was opened. Then there would have been probably some rage and some accusations and some fud and the usual. Then I would most likely have sold some stuff, acquired a bitcoin in restitution and then significantly increased my social klout for demonstrating I'm one of the good ones.</p><p>Or some crap. I dunno. You know the drill, this is crypto. We would have made good anyway. Although I don't know how tripped the lottery mechanics would have been.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>The launch of the experiment was very well publicised, yet the ending was silent.</em></p><p><em>If this was one of the expected outcomes, why did you not release any post-mortem or final public statement?</em></p><p><strong><em>Robin:</em></strong></p><p>Expected outcomes makes it sound like we expected someone to exploit the code this way. We didn't.</p><p>Inherently we knew there would be a target on the NFTs back but the hope was that by creating an involving and entertaining experience we would raise the value of the art to the point where it was worth more and would be respected more.</p><p>You know? Even though you know you can exploit you don't.</p><p>This was an idea that I floated in the initial build up. I exposed my private keys and let people take my tokens. Almost everyone gave them back but it was someone outside of the group that didn't.</p><p>The timing of the exploit was bad for me, after the year we had I'd switched off crypto for a period to get some family time. As for a post-mortem I was actually planning on doing an episode of the Defiant on it but when you got in touch it felt like that would be a better avenue to put the story out.</p><p>The other thing is, there's a major assumption here that the whole thing has ended.</p><p>That isn't the case. The NFTs still exist, there's still a community here, I don't think it's necessarily a full stop. It's been a slow pickup to the new year but myself and the Meme team would like to create a new chapter but we've not had a chance to connect on what that might be.</p><p><strong>Ultimately we promised a rug pull and that's exactly what happened.</strong></p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>The attacker made a public warning about the vulnerability a month before the exploit.</em></p><p><em>Do you think this was handled appropriately?</em></p><p><strong><em>Robin:</em></strong></p><p>Depends how you look at it. There's a big difference between posting one message in a discord channel and contacting a team privately to discuss.</p><p>I don't know whether you read every single message in every social app you use but I certainly don't.</p><p>Unfortunately the team didn't appear to have seen it. But if the attacker was motivated by helping the team fix and mitigate the vulnerability then he would have been more persistent about flagging it.</p><p>Ultimately he has a nice f-you record to prove his point and I understand the flex. It wasn't handled because it wasn't seen. I don't think there's any blame attributable to the team for that.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>This experiment was an entirely new concept, and although it may not have lasted, it does make us think about the creative opportunities that digital scarcity allows for.</em></p><p><em>What’s your most far-out prediction for the future of NFTs?</em></p><p><strong><em>Robin:</em></strong></p><p>What I find crazy is SOCKS, that people would buy an NFT that represents socks and never ever need to own those socks but they can trade the value.</p><p>This is just derivatives of course but if you extend that notion then literally anything can be an NFT. Every single item in the world can find a digital twin in a metaverse. And at that point you get into some really wild ideas around production, fulfilment, sustainability and beyond.</p><p>Digital fashion is the area that feels the most ripe for a major move in 2021. When the picture, your digital record on Instagram, is all that matters then owning a real garment is kind of secondary. So we get into these notions of signalling and badging ourselves digitally without there needing to be a shady sweatshop involved.</p><p>I haven't gone far enough in thinking about NFTs and what they can be but I know there's a great deal more that we haven't even begun thinking about yet but I'm happy to be one of the ones experimenting with it.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Thanks for your time Robin, do you have anything else you'd like to say to our readers?</em></p><p><strong><em>Robin:</em></strong></p><p><strong>Don't overcommit to anything you don't understand. It's going to be a wild year but you have to keep your sane brain engaged.</strong></p><hr/><p><strong>They promised a rug pull and that’s what happened.</strong></p><p>We always encourage our readers to think outside the box, to consider all possibilities when investigating a situation. Although unlikely, there’s no evidence to suggest this wasn’t an inside job. Not directly from the team, but maybe from someone associated...</p><p><strong>The MEME team may be more suspicious than usual at the moment, and they would be right in being so...</strong></p><p>Although the code could have been more secure, this seems to be more of a failed experiment than total incompetence.</p><p>However, it’s understandable that some players are disappointed with the outcome, and in some ways this feels worse than some of the larger hacks.</p><p><strong>It’s like card counting at a children's poker night. It’s not technically against the rules, but it definitely spoiled the fun for a few innocent people who were just trying something new.</strong>

This proves the value of this personal information; whoever was paying those prices will have expected to profit from their purchase.</p><p><strong>Since the information has become free to access, users have been <a href=""https://twitter.com/thecryptomonk/status/1340973317461860352?s=20"">reporting </a>an <a href=""https://twitter.com/JimmyMcShill/status/1340935239959535618?s=20"">increase </a>in <a href=""https://twitter.com/bneiluj/status/1340787535128260615?s=20"">phishing </a>attempts.

This database may be used by scammers for phishing attacks through emailing and text message campaigns.</em></p><p><em>Our Customer Support team has been working to notify our users via Twitter and responding to questions while also reporting all tweets and Reddit posts that contain a link to the database.

Greed and impatience don’t earn our respect, but when an individual is targeted through no fault of their own, they deserve to be shown some compassion.</p><p><strong>This attack could have happened to any one of us.</strong></p><p>We spoke to Hugh one week after the attack took place. The following summary is from his official <a href=""https://medium.com/@hugh_karp/nxm-hack-update-72c5c017b48"">statement</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>On Monday 14th of December at 9:40am UTC, I was tricked into approving a single <a href=""https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4ddcc21c6de13b3cf472c8d4cdafd80593e0fc286c67ea144a76dbeddb7f3629"">transaction</a> that sent 370,000 NXM to a hacker instead of what I thought was claiming some mining rewards. The hacker has subsequently liquidated the majority of the NXM into ETH/BTC and has been dispersing it to many different addresses and exchanges.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Hi Hugh,</em></p><p><em>Thanks for talking to us, we want to say first of all; we're sorry that this happened to you.</em></p><p><em>We didn't want to cover this story without talking to you first, as obviously there is much more of a personal element to this attack than those which we normally cover.</em></p><p><em>It’s been just over one week since the hack - financial loss aside, how has the incident affected you?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>it's been pretty rough to be honest, an emotional roller coaster and not much sleep, especially the first few days but things are settling now.</p><p>The first 3 hours or so were definitely the worst, as I'm sure many others in crypto have experienced. You get that gut-wrenching sick feeling and my whole body was shaking and quite weak.</p><p>The Nexus team and others in the community really helped out here, Rox (our CTO) and Anatol (our security expert) took control of the situation and guided me on next steps. Then the wider community started getting involved with tracing funds and other things.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>I'm not surprised that a $8m loss causes some physical side effects - that must have been awful.</em></p><p><em>How are you handling it psychologically?  Has it changed how you think about the industry?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>I think I'm doing alright on that front, I tend to take a long term view of things, and before DeFi summer really kicked off NXM was only around $3. So while I've most certainly lost a lot of money, I didn't have that money 4-5 months ago. A start-up is a rollercoaster anyway, so this is just another down section, I'm confident things will turn around.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Your written summary of the incident is fascinating.</em></p><p><em>In one section you write;</em></p><p><em>""There are connections with other victims of what we believe are similar attacks.""</em></p><p><em>Can you explain these connections?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>I can't give too much detail right now, as there are still investigations ongoing but we know of at least 2 other Nexus Mutual members that appear to have been impacted by a similar incident. And anecdotally, through other contacts there are several other victims that have been impacted. We found the two accounts as we were tracing movement of funds.</p><p>I guess there are views going around that this was a highly targeted attack that regular Defi users don't have to concern themselves with. I guess that is correct on some level, but I would point out you don't have to be high profile to be targeted. In general, I'd caution against the view that ""it's not going to happen to me"".</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>You were using a hardware wallet, your private keys weren't compromised - what can users do to prevent this happening to them?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>I've been thinking about this since the attack, and I'm honestly not sure on the best solution. The hardware wallet will show enough information so you can verify exactly what you're approving but you have to be quite technical to understand it. Simple transfers for well known tokens are fine, but any smart contract interaction is likely next to impossible for regular users to understand. Personally, I'm going to check the full tx info against external sources from now on, but I don't think that's a viable solution for everybody.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>In the summary, you write ""My computer was compromised and Metamask was altered from disk""</em></p><p><em>Do you have any ideas how your computer was compromised?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>We don't have a full idea as yet, we're still running full diagnostics on my PC. We believe malware was served from coinbene dot team but it is possible it came from somewhere else.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>There were some messages on Twitter that suggested you had identified the attacker, can you tell us about your communication with them?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>Our CTO, Roxana, had a brief telegram conversation with one of the hackers, but we also connected them to other hack victims by tracing transactions and talking with police. I can't really disclose anymore on this front for the time being, apart from saying we believe they are a highly sophisticated hacking group.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Have you spoken to law enforcement about the hack?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>Yes, we've spoken to UK police who are also coordinating with other jurisdictions. Other cases have been linked up so they are being treated as a larger investigation.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Did you feel that the police were well experienced in dealing with this sort of case?</em></p><p><em>We cover a lot of hacks and exploits involving huge sums of money, but it seems that they are rarely brought to the attention of law enforcement - why do you think that is?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>Not really, they seem mainly set up for things like credit card fraud and other smaller items. The other big challenge is the international aspect, that slows down response times and coordination efforts.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Insurance protocols offer hackers the opportunity to multiply their profits by taking insurance before hacking a protocol - have you ever seen evidence of this happening - should this be allowed to happen?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>We haven't seen it happen ourselves yet, though I'm sure it will. At Nexus Mutual we introduced proof of loss so you need to prove you control an account that suffered a loss. This will prevent the worst impacts.</p><p>Insurance products can work without this criteria, but they will be much more expensive in the long run, as extra claims will be paid. For long term sustainable products it's better to align interests as much as possible.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>The community set up a <a href=""https://gitcoin.co/grants/1848/donations-to-hugh-karp-for-the-recent-hack-of-pers"">Gitcoin grant</a> to refund some of your losses - you stated the funds would be used to develop wallet security tools - can you give us some details?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>That's right. I haven't established the exact details yet, but the goal is to encourage solutions, or progress on technical items, for highly secure personal wallets that are also great from a UX perspective. I know lots of teams are working on this, but we still have some way to go and I think it's critical that wider crypto space has great options for self-custody. My particular situation is relatively high profile but the issue isn't isolated to me, so hopefully this is an opportunity to spur further progress.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>If our readers want to help or learn more about this project, where should they go?</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>If you'd like to donate to the grant, <a href=""https://gitcoin.co/grants/1848/donations-to-hugh-karp-for-the-recent-hack-of-pers"">here is the link:</a></p><p>If you'd like to learn more about Nexus Mutual you can find us <a href=""https://twitter.com/nexusmutual"">@NexusMutual</a> on Twitter or join our <a href=""https://discord.com/invite/xxFaAEn"">Discord here</a>.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Thanks for talking to us.</em></p><p><strong>Hugh:</strong></p><p>No problem at all, I appreciate the opportunity and thanks for being a bit more delicate!</p></section>"

<strong>Next time, take care of your own shit.</strong><p></p><p>Infinite mint but it’s no Willy Wonka - this is a Hollywood classic insurance themed noir.</p><p>The black and white outcomes of insurance policies lend themselves well to Hollywood storylines.</p><p><strong>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKrrAa2o9Eg"">Double Indemnity</a> (1944), insurance is the motivating force for both good and evil.</strong></p><p>The film takes its name from a life insurance clause that offers double payouts if the death of the policyholder is accidental.</p><p>This results in a twisting plot as an insurance salesman is roped into a murderous scheme by his lover, who wants him to murder her husband and frame it as an accident in order to profit from the payout.</p><p><strong>Never take anything at face value.</strong> DeFi plot lines are rarely straightforward. Anonymity and composability are the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy; there are multiple ways one can profit from a single incident, meaning smart players don’t always take the most obvious reward.</p><p><strong>$9.4m taken, $3.2m recovered and $6.2m lost.</strong></p><p><strong>COVER (formerly known as SAFE) fell ~<a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cover-protocol"">90%</a> when an infinite mint loophole was uncovered and exploited,</strong> causing the total supply of tokens to increase by 48 quadrillion percent, from 84,477 to 40,796,131,214,802,600,000.</p><p>Six different addresses minted COVER via this loophole before it was closed. <strong>Some kept the money, others did not.</strong></p><p>Of the six addresses to use the loophole, the previously <a href=""https://medium.com/@grap.finance"">unknown</a><a href=""https://etherscan.io/token/0xC8D2AB2a6FdEbC25432E54941cb85b55b9f152dB"">Grap Finance</a> gained the most attention, as they took the opportunity to present themselves as a “White hat” by selling minted COVER for ETH and returning it with a sassy message.</p><p><strong>Code is law, but loopholes remain</strong> - we can rely on attackers to take advantage, but we know things are rarely as simple as they seem.</p><p>Who had cover on their $COVER? We went undercover to find out.

In total 14 security issues spanning across all severity levels were identified, along with a few deviations from the specification, code documentation issues and best practice issues. Due to the poor documentation we were not able to determine how the developers have derived some of the implemented formulas from the StableSwap whitepaper. Additionally, we have noticed that all tests in the current test suite use exactly 2 tokens in the pool. We strongly recommend adding more tests that use 3 or more tokens and addressing all identified issues before deploying the code in production.</em></p><p><strong><em>The implemented relation looks different (from the original StableSwap).

This is just one of many underhand techniques that will be used to try and prevent the public from taking control of their own money.</p><p>Attempts to smear our industry and slow our progress via legislation are nothing new, but the STABLE act represents a change in political strategy. <strong>These are direct shots intended to limit our progress;</strong> the opening salvo of a new set of arguments that will define the next face of regulatory battles for the entire crypto industry.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EP358A2VzVlgWHqbb8fPR6vla4kRi65eGoueBkSnpAxQPM3VfMTUntNHF_lyOaHGRKDwuVBZU_pfUapRoYNnbrQR9BzxSjZ-nXPxhV7kDeQ1t1uLXtjTvIRRCGm0iFeFomLIz0Hn""/></figure>
<strong>Violence in the digital age.</strong><p></p><p>Old and powerful forces are preparing to fight.</p><p><strong>The creation of Bitcoin was a direct attack on the existing system. Now the empire is striking back.</strong></p><p>The STABLE act is the first of many; only one of the potential attack vectors that the US government may take. We will soon see more aggressive strategies deployed to try and change the course of progress.</p><p>It has long been expected that Tether will fall victim to US regulation, and many fear the impact that this will have on the markets. However, price action is temporary, and if Tether falls, other coins will take its place.</p><p>The on and off ramps to cryptocurrency will be closely monitored by the more jealous governments, who will seek any excuse to limit sales of their devalued currency.</p><p><strong>Details do not change the trend.</strong> Despite their impact in the short term, when we zoom out to a longer timeframe, we see these actions to be just the final throes of a dying system.</p><p>It’s not just tokenised USD that will change the world. For those who wish to increase international exposure to their currency, tokenising their fiat presents an excellent way to gain an international advantage. As the inevitability of stablecoin adoption dawns, we enter a <a href=""https://blogs.imf.org/2019/09/26/from-stablecoins-to-central-bank-digital-currencies/"">race</a> between nations and corporations to release the first widely adopted and fully regulated stablecoin.</p><p><strong>The STABLE act, although clumsy in it's presentation, is likely to have more strategy to it than is immediately apparent. The United States will be carefully planning how to position themselves when the EU and China issue their digital currency.</strong></p><p>Globalisation of culture, currency, and commerce will provide opportunities for citizens of all nations; the most successful governments over the next 20 years will be those who are comfortable enough to promote these opportunities and successfully adapt to the changing paradigm.</p><p>Brain drain will be accelerated with the flick of a switch, as the brightest minds move to countries with the most favourable financial regulation. Governments will play an equilibrist game, as they try to win re-election by pleasing both the masses and the new financial elite in order to earn their taxes.</p><p><strong>Money 3.0 has little baggage</strong>, and can find itself equally at home in New York, London, Singapore, or the Bermudas depending on how well they are treated.</p><p>Governments who don’t adapt will fall, and the wraithlike entities of Web 3.0 will flourish beyond their grasp.</p><p><em>An iron fist holds no weight in <a href=""https://blas.com/the-sovereign-individual/"">cyberspace</a>, where the meek and the mighty meet on equal terms.</em>

We asked kferret if they were happy with the official response.</p><blockquote><p>""I am certainly not happy with how Armor has handled the situation. I think it is totally unacceptable that the CEO of Armor would make statements in order to induce people to stake valuable assets, promising us that we get to keep the benefits of the cover NFTs and could withdraw and claim at any time during this phase of the project.

Just last week, Armor launched an industry first Coverage for Coverage Providers, collateralized by the Armor Treasury Reserve.

This is an example of how Armor, without the consent of stakers, decided to change the rules about what they can do with our funds. At no point was I ever informed during the staking flow that I would have a risk of loss of benefits during this phase or that the benefits would be used to provide protection to users of another yield vault. Azeem explicitly stated that since arCore Protect is not active yet, if we need to claim we can claim as normal and the benefits still belong to us.""</em></p><p><strong><em>""The 1,000 ETH received will flow into the treasury reserve where they will be used to acquire NXM to replenish the burnt stakes in the arNXM yield vault to fully compensate the stakers of the vault. This will replenish any impacts to arNXM:wNXM ratio""</em></strong></p><p><strong>kferret:</strong> <em>I originally offered to set aside a contribution of $100,000 for the purpose of reimbursing some of the losses in this vault. I think this is quite generous. Azeem agreed to this and seemed quite satisfied, directing his co-founder Robert to start the transfer of the NFT back to me. This never happened. Hours later, “Umadbruhh” delivered the letter to me basically saying nothing the CEO says is binding. When is it acceptable that the CEO can just make a deal, and later on decide that nothing he said applies?</em></p><blockquote><p>The following is taken from the official letter delivered to kferret from Armor team member “Umadbruhh”</p></blockquote><p><strong><em>""Dear x7044, I’m Umadbruhh, co-founder of Armor and responsible for maintaining protocol health. Having discussed this with the team and following the rules as described in our technical documentation, we offer the following resolution.""</em></strong></p><p><strong>kferret:</strong> <em>""It is important to note that the technical documentation does not reflect the current state of the product. Many, if not most, of the documentation pages at the time contained information that did not reflect the actual working product. Given the complete mismatch, it would be hard to rely on any of the information there. Therefore, I think any reasonable person would expect to be able to rely on the CEO’s statements about how the system is presently working especially if the documentation is largely inaccurate.""</em></p><p><strong><em>""The informal yet caveated conversation you have had with az does not represent the final decision of Armor as it must be subject to the agreement of the team during the governance grace period or the DAO under normal circumstances. Furthermore, the official technical documentation supersedes any informal discussions or statements that may or may not have been misconstrued.""</em></strong></p><p><strong>kferret:</strong> <em>""This is just another way to say that we can’t rely on anything they say, everything they say can be false or invalidated whenever they feel like it. Does that sound like the practices of an organization you really want to trust with staking your assets or buying coverage?""</em></p><p><strong><em>""You are fully aware that the way the system works is that users like yourself acquire and stake arNFTs with Armor as suppliers. Once staked, the arNFT does NOT provide coverage to the user as it is now leased to the system in return for compensation in the form of token rewards and/or revshare. (ref - <a href=""https://armorfi.gitbook.io/armor/products/arnft-coverage-pool/staking-into-arcore"">https://armorfi.gitbook.io/armor/products/arnft-coverage-pool/staking-into-arcore</a>)
“Note: Staked arNFTs do not provide coverage to the user who staked them.”
Azeem unequivocally clarified that during this stage of the product, while cover brokerage is not active, this is not true and stakers retain coverage and can claim. He confirmed this multiple times.""</em></strong></p><p><strong>kferret:</strong> <em>""This part of the product isn’t launched, they are selectively extracting text related to unlaunched parts of the product and adding arbitrary terms and conditions to justify them doing whatever they want at my expense. No one has bought coverage from Armor. It is also unclear if anything resembling a DAO exists at all at this point.""</em></p><p><strong><em>""Armor is the sole stakeholder in this decision because:
Armor retains all rights to the arNFT when staked, so all claim submission rights and payouts belong to Armor during the period the arNFT is being staked. This includes the 7 day cooldown period after the unstake request has been triggered, which was included to address instances similar to this and to allow Armor DAO to determine the appropriate course of action.
If the arNFT is allowed to be withdrawn, Armor DAO stands to lose a significant amount of its stake on the yearn contract which will be paid to someone who did not own the rights to this claim. You will appreciate that this is neither ethical nor payable in the circumstances.""</em></strong></p><p><strong>kferret:</strong> <em>""Just remember, the next time Armor is going to make a decision about your assets, this is going to be their mantra: “Armor is the sole stakeholder”. Armor only looks after Armor. They have clearly demonstrated that now.""</em></p><p><strong><em>""The normal course of action would have been the claim is made and paid out to the Armor treasury. But since we realise that no material loss has resulted to users of arCore Protect in this hack or anyone covered by this specific arNFT, it is imperative for Armor to determine the best decision for the protocol and community that is fair and justified. Therefore, Armor will claim the payout and use it to provide coverage to stakers in the arNXM yield vault.</em>""</strong></p><p><strong><em>""At the same time however, we would like to come to an amicable understanding with all parties. You are a supporter of Armor for which we are grateful and honored. This is simply one of the reasons we feel you will agree that any decision must be made transparently and should not be made unilaterally or without the existence of any duty, in order to benefit any one specific user at the expense to and indeed of the community.""</em></strong></p><p><strong>kferret:</strong> <em>""Armor’s definition of coming to an amicable understanding with all parties must mean agreeing to a deal, then totally reneging, then informing me all of the final terms of a completely different new deal in which only Armor got to select all of the terms and I had no say at all. Yes, this certainly sounds like it’s not “made unilaterally”.

You are missing a key point.
He claims to have relied on ambiguous statements before he staked, when in fact he staked a day before the statements.
This discredits his entire argument as he did not in fact rely on those statements at all for staking.
When staked the coverage is assigned to Armor. This is made clear in the documentation.
If you want to retain coverage then don't stake.
There are several other NFTs who were not staked and successfully claimed with no issue.</p><p>You keep asking me for opinions and I am giving you facts.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>In a public Telegram group you wrote:</em></p><p><em>""The rights to the arNFT belong to Armor when staked.

However I did not and do not.</p><p>Hence the disclaimer which ferret did not deem convenient to his social pressure campaign to disclose.
One individual can not unilaterally dictate a response superseded by a protocol with rules which ferret was aware of considering he staked a day prior to ambiguous statements he claimed to rely on, and he continued to leave other NFTs staked after claiming he wouldn't have had he known
Straight up lies
While I am providing you real evidence completely discrediting his claims.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>How did a decentralised protocol decide to take the NFT from kferret, as evidenced in the transactions uncovered by <a href=""https://twitter.com/Luciano_vPEPO/status/1358276206693670913?s=20"">Luciano</a>?</em></p><p><strong>Azeem:</strong></p><p>Do you know how to read on chain data.

Any misunderstandings are down to being overly careful and seeking to do the right thing.
And as reminder (sends links to <a href=""https://twitter.com/RobertMCForster/status/1359226703906623489?s=20"">RobertMCForster thread</a> stating that Armor stands to profit a total of $0 from their decisions on this matter).</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>If you could go back to the start of this incident, what would you do differently?</em></p><p><strong>Azeem:</strong></p><p>Protocol design is complete however not all fully automated as the complete system is fairly complex and this is why we are in the first couple weeks of a rolling phased launch_
The misunderstandings are based on human elements.
What I would do differently, is to have sought to have done absolutely nothing and let the system be executed as designed, which is what was followed in the end
It's just because of misunderstandings potentially affecting due process that any of this drama happened at all.</p><p>While I understand your readers want to hear what I have to say, this is again, not about who said what. Strongly recommend you review those links as they provide important details to the information shared in this discussion.
I'm not trying to share my opinion with you, sharing with you the facts.
Also thanks for asking what would have been done differently, good question.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>This interview is about ""who said what"" though. Your comments were used against you by kferret.</em></p><p><em>We'll provide the links, but this is your opportunity to speak directly to kferret and to those who judged you (perhaps too quickly) based on your previous misunderstandings which have led to similar drama.</em></p><p><strong>Azeem:</strong></p><p>I disagree with your position of this interview being about who said what.
It's about one person said X and here's YZ evidence disproving it.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>OK. We want to apologise to you for the way we covered the story.</em></p><p><strong>Azeem:</strong></p><p>Thank you bud, I do appreciate the apology.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>We based our opinion on a preconception and allowed that to interfere with our investigation</em></p><p><em>Do you have any final message for our readers?</em></p><p><strong>Azeem:</strong></p><p>I am confident that having seen all the evidence, it will be obvious to the community the grift that kferret has tried to pull with his social media FUD campaign. Based on the overwhelming support we have received, the community realizes and respects the fact that Armor will always follow protocol and stand with our users even in the face of immense pressure from a whale VC. arNFTs are tokenized Nexus Mutual coverage. Holding these arNFTs gives the user the right to claim a payout in the case of a hack. There have already been 3 other successful arNFT claims for the yearn hack by people who did not stake and kept the arNFT for coverage, 10E, 15E, and 100E - the system is actually being used successfully as intended by our users.</p><p>When arNFTs are staked with Armor, they do NOT provide coverage to the user who staked them as is made absolutely clear in the documentation and there is no doubt that kferret would have been aware of this. He had staked the arNFT with Armor in return for rewards. The user claims my statement led him to believe his arNFT could be unstaked if there was a claim. However, the statement being referred to was not made in response to kferret, or in reference to his specific situation. It also seems the user did not deem it convenient to his FUD campaign to disclose screenshots of messages where I specifically disclaimed my comments directly to him as subject to team approval. The Armor protocol is an independent entity of which I am not a dictator and I cannot make unilateral decisions superseding it. In addition, on-chain data shows I made those statements after the user had already staked. He staked the arNFT knowing the rules. He also claims he would not have staked if he had known better; which he does now, so why is he still staking 2 other arNFTs with Armor? Why does he continue to earn rewards on all 3?</p><p>Armor protocol focuses on creating innovative solutions to provide better coverage to all DeFi. Currently, we are in the process of launching the Armor V1 suite. We have already achieved $548m in active coverage, and we have already begun work on the next iteration of Armor which will streamline UX and add a myriad of new features and products.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Thank you for your time</em></p><hr/><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://github.com/RektHQ/Assets/blob/main/images/2021/02/linebreak.png?raw=true""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>Now that we have heard both sides of the story, the outcome is not so clear.</strong></p><p>Is kferret a deceptive whale who used the community’s preconception in his favour, or are we being tricked by Armor, who claim to be decentralised yet rule with a human hand?</p><p>Nobody has come out of this fight unharmed.</p><p><strong>All parties trusted, yet did not verify, and everyone lost as a result.</strong></p><p>Now that all our words are immortalised online, they can easily come back to haunt us.</p><p>When “who said what” defines who gets what, then even lies are as good as gold.

Users have bought and sold land and assets in games such as <a href=""http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page"">OpenSim</a> and IMVU for years, but as the supporting technology improves, and the number of players increases, the amount of money changing hands becomes much more serious.</p><p>With the rise of VR and the addition of non-fungible tokens, the increasing demand for virtual belongings will soon be satisfied and monetised like never before.</p><p><strong>The drugs market was the first to prove that there’s profit to be made from those who seek to escape reality.</strong></p><p>Now money flows freely across virtual lands, where everything has its price.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/ue-xanadu-break.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>The market for digital real estate is booming.</strong></p><p>Keen investors with a long-term vision are spending millions of dollars to acquire plots of land in games such as Decentraland, Axie Infinity and Somnium Space.</p><p>Land is the number one selling digital asset across all virtual worlds, and NFTs of virtual real estate are among the <a href=""https://opensea.io/rankings"">top ten NFTs</a> currently being traded across all markets.</p><p><strong>One of the recent sales was the largest yet</strong> -  $1.5 million for a plot of digital land in Axie Infinity.</p><p>Buyer <a href=""https://twitter.com/Its_Falcon_Time/status/1358919496099110915?s=20"">“Its_Falcon_Time”</a> used Twitter to explain their investment thesis.</p><blockquote><p>We're witnessing a historic moment; the rise of digital nations with their own systems of clearly delineated, irrevocable property rights.

Decentraland currently has devs that like to build games. Cryptovoxels has artists, The Sandbox has gamers, etc.</p><p>As each evolves they will connect at some point but as the space 100x's in crypto native traffic, they should all co-exist just fine imo.</p><p>The long term vision or confidence comes from the market strength. I.e, projects have sold $10's of millions of land so when buying at a certain price, you feel confident you can get it back.</p><p>Also, it's a way to mess around and play with the possibilities of this tech. So some investors are just people that buy to build cool things and experiment with what blockchain can do visually.</p><p>As a larger investor, you're also betting on being able to bring enough value to help the project succeed so most have plans to bring big projects in.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/ue-eye-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>If Matty is correct in his belief that the investors long-term vision comes from the current market strength, then are the buyers being short sighted in their purchase, or do they see something that we don’t?</strong></p><p>How much of their investment will still stand once the current bull market inevitably ends?</p><p>A “two to three year build time” for a VR platform is still incredibly short when we consider the ecosystem which they can then support. As NFTs allow for easy monetisation of virtual worlds, we will soon see unprecedented levels of capital arrive to fund their development and take advantage of this new business model.</p><p><strong>How will the next phase of VR development play out?</strong></p><p>We spoke to Sam Hamilton, the community manager of <a href=""https://decentraland.org/"">Decentraland</a>, to find out what he had to say:</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/ue-hall-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Once the existing games industry catches on to the potential profit of including NFTs into their major game releases, what will happen to Decentraland?</em></p><p><strong>Sam:</strong></p><p>I wouldn’t say that Decentraland is competing with the gaming industry, I think of it as more of a social platform that has been gamified. We are likely to be competing in the future with brands such as Facebook but our transparent, open standard, Decentralised model is the polar opposite of what the current social media platforms strive for.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>How does Decentraland plan to remain competitive as the industry expands?</em></p><p><strong>Sam:</strong></p><p>It’s free to play and The Foundation is a non profit organisation that has development funds for at least the next 10 years. The community owns and drives the platform and also has around $6 million of funding per year for the next 10 years, that in itself will keep the platform relevant. Blockchain and AI will disrupt many industries including gaming. I think we are living through a paradigm shift as important as the birth of the internet.</p><p><strong>People are already living in virtual worlds like Facebook and Youtube but the UI is really terrible.</strong> I don’t think evolving the way we interact with the web will change what seems like an inherent human instinct to interact with technology. Full immersion may have it’s own psychological side effects which it would be good for makers of hardware to keep an eye on.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/ue-linebreak3.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>What new psychological issues await us as we ascend into our second reality?</strong></p><p>The next phase of VR will change the world as we know it.</p><p>We are already accustomed to long hours of screen time. Once we remove the bandwidth issue of our physical limitations and enter a fully immersive virtual experience, there will be no going back.</p><p><strong>The inevitability is almost intimidating, but the good far outweighs the bad.</strong></p><p>The time is right for a boost in development of VR platforms. These builders did not stop through the crypto winter, now the current bull market and the increased public interest brings them a well deserved set of keen new users.</p><p>Bull markets are not just good news for traders and investors. Builders also benefit from the increased public attention and extra liquidity. If it were not for the initial bull run of the large cap cryptos, then the NFT craze may not have come about so soon.</p><p>The general consensus seems to be that this market cycle is one of “real adoption” rather than just speculation, but as the two often turn up together, could this all be standard bull market euphoria?</p><p>Mark Cuban’s answer to the above is predictable, and indeed, his arrival and now regular presence within DeFi and NFTs serves as a market indicator via growing public interest. Along with characters such as <a href=""https://rekt.eth.link/nft-digital-art-enthusiast/"">Gary Vee and Linsday Lohan</a>, NFTs and the concept of digital ownership seem to have caught the public eye much faster than the cryptocurrency technology upon which they are built.</p><p><strong>Perhaps Joe Public is more interested in ownership than investment.</strong></p><p>In Mark Cubans’ recent post, <a href=""https://blogmaverick.com/2021/01/31/the-store-of-value-generation-is-kicking-your-ass-and-you-dont-even-know-it/"">Store of Value</a>, he explains why he believes that “this generation is the one that will bring in mass acceptance of digital goods as investments.”</p><p><strong>But what about digital <em>belongings?</em></strong></p><p>In the offline world, we do not consider every possession as an investment; they are simply items we accumulate. Sometimes for a purpose, sometimes for sentimental reasons, occasionally as investments, but it’s safe to say that we do not purchase most of our physical belongings with a plan to resell them in the future.</p><p><strong>Why are we even more materialistic online?</strong></p><p>This question is not a new one.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/ue-daedalus.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/"">The Daedalus Project</a> was an online survey of MMORPG players.</strong> It was abandoned in 2009, but the archives are still available. On that site, in a <a href=""http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001644.php"">post</a> titled <em>“The Unbearable Likeness of Being”</em>, the author describes his thoughts on materialism in the online game of Second Life.</p><blockquote><p>What's so odd about Second Life to me is that in a world where people can be anyone and do anything they want, that Second Life looks so much like Suburban America, except maybe with even more materialism than in real life.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In a world where beauty is a click of the button away and where that form-fitting pair of designer jeans costs almost nothing, it makes it easy to spend way more time and effort on our virtual appearance and jeans than the ones we have in real life. Thus, in a strange way, the virtual world somehow can make us more focused on the physical and material aspects of the world.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Virtual worlds make it easier to play out and satisfy the material needs we have in the physical world.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Twelve years have passed since those words were written, but the idea still stands true.</p><p>As we steadily progress into a tokenised world, our materialistic goals will be increasingly enabled and encouraged as corporations join us in fueling, but never satisfying, our own consumerist desire.</p><p><strong>However, this industry will not always rely on speculation.</strong></p><p>Utilitarian digital items such as <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9ki2et/someone_wants_to_buy_my_instagram_username_for/"">usernames</a> or <a href=""https://www.namecheap.com/blog/top-domain-sales-first-half-2020/"">domain names</a> regularly sell for thousands, and the reasons are now easily understood and accepted. The same thing will happen with NFTs.</p><p>As their adoption progresses and Web 3.0 becomes the standard, VR will further encourage the use of NFT art, and other blockchain based digital assets will arise; more utilitarian in their nature. Maybe then the main consumer goals will shift from pure profit, to possession and utility, as they usually are offline.</p><p><strong>We approached the founder of <a href=""https://somniumspace.com/"">Somnium Space</a> to find out more.</strong></p><p>Usually we conduct all our interviews by text, but when <a href=""https://twitter.com/ASychov/status/1367091326026670081?s=19"">Artur Sychov</a> was so insistent to call us on Zoom, we eventually accepted.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/ue-somniumspace.png""/></figure><p></p><p>In the following ten minutes, Artur proceeded to explain how the combination of VR and blockchain will change the world as we know it.

Early adopters are always ignored at first, and if it weren’t for their passion / obsession with their topic - <em>kindling the spark of an idea whilst all around them dismiss it</em>, then technology simply would not progress.</p><p><strong>Today’s VR/NFT developers are building much more than just gaming platforms; they are laying the foundations for a new reality.</strong> The graphics and design choices at this stage may detract from the utilitarian potential, but once you see past that, it’s easy to share in the excitement.</p><p>Artur is not alone in his belief that within 10 - 15 years we will see entire cities, even countries formed within VR, and that the few hours a day we now spend on our phones will pale into insignificance in a future where all reality is at least augmented.</p><p>Once we fully embrace VR, and as the hardware steadily shrinks to the size of a contact lens, two once parallel worlds will collide on-chain as a virtual reality becomes indistinguishable from our own.</p><p>Access to an alternate reality will level the economic playing field, as citizens of countries who were unable to participate in the global economy have a chance to start afresh in a virtual world.</p><p>Over the coming years, big money sales and high valuations of digital items will continue to make headlines, and players will work hard to build their online riches, <em>but perhaps they’re looking for value in all the wrong places.</em></p><p><strong>If these games could only be played against AI, users would not be interested.</strong></p><p>Studies have shown that social gaming enhances the emotional experiences from said game.</p><blockquote><p>Study participants who played a competitive game against a human-controlled opponent reported more experiences of presence, flow, and enjoyment (than against a computer-opponent), whereby the strongest effect referred to the experience of presence. <a href=""https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-09010-033"">(Weibel, D, et al 2008)</a></p></blockquote><p>These findings translate directly to VR social interaction.

<strong>The dark arts of DeFi remain the most profitable.</strong><p></p><p>What follows is one of our most dramatic stories yet.</p><p><strong>A tale of fake magic, confusion and accusation leading to the biggest DeFi hack to date.</strong></p><p>~$37.5 million was stolen in a complex piece of DeFi deception, as a multi transaction attack was used to raid the vaults of Alpha Finance, whilst leaving many believing that it was the Iron Bank that had been affected.</p><p>This murder took place in a <a href=""https://youtu.be/F-BqDWG72iM"">hall of mirrors</a>. The increasingly intertwined nature of DeFi protocols, combined with the complexity of the attack, left the community confused as to who the real victim was, and who was responsible for making reparations.</p><p>The attackers' contract made the Homora code “believe” that their malicious contract was one of their own in order to manipulate internal debt numbers in their system.</p><p><strong>This was a private battle between protocol and attacker.</strong> The exploited contract was not yet announced, nor was it available to users, meaning they were not directly affected. We have not yet seen such a blatant inside job, and Alpha Finance were quick to point out that they had a <a href=""https://twitter.com/AlphaFinanceLab/status/1360623172433760256?s=20"">“prime suspect”</a>.</p><p>Why was the contract left on mainnet if it was not yet ready? We asked Alpha Finance, who told us;</p><blockquote><p>""We launched several pools e.g. sUSD on the contract level and not the UI because we were preparing to launch new pools including sUSD that coming week""</p></blockquote><p><strong>Large players quickly moved to preserve their capital amidst the confusion.</strong> SBF withdrew <a href=""https://twitter.com/_wilbur4ce_/status/1360636958595305474?s=20"">$400 million</a> of FTT from Cream Finance, and <a href=""https://etherscan.io/address/0x5cfd0cddf989959a6a6c3ad985ce324460d46dfd"">Three Arrows Capital</a> sent over <a href=""https://twitter.com/Raez_x/status/1360542616849375233?s=20"">$3 million</a> of $ALPHA to Binance, where the only purpose could be to sell.</p><p>All tokens related to the attack decreased in value.</p><p>The Alpha Homora governance token <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alpha-finance"">ALPHA</a> fell from $2.25 to $1.78.</p><p>The Iron Bank governance token <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cream"">CREAM</a> fell from $288.32 to $193.51.
<a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aave"">AAVE</a>, the governance from the home of the controversial flash loan which has enabled so many attacks of this nature, fell from $518 to a low of $492 later in the day.</p><p><strong>However, token pricing is not the most interesting aspect of this story...</strong></p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/02/linebreak-shanghai2.png""/></figure><p></p><p>The Alpha Finance team built an excellent <a href=""https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-post-mortem/"">post-mortem</a>, and what they found was startling. The implications of our joint investigation suggest a depth of corruption much worse than expected.</p><p>Whether Alpha Finance goes public with their accusations remains to be seen, but their initial statement of having a prime suspect suggests that repercussions are coming.</p><p><strong>From the official post-mortem, we can see that the attacker needed to know the following in order to carry out the attack:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>HomoraBankv2 has an sUSD pool on a contract level in preparation for the upcoming release, which is neither available on the UI nor publicly announced.</strong></li><li><strong>There was no liquidity in sUSD lending pool</strong>, so the attacker can fully manipulate and inflate the total debt amount and total debt share.</li><li><strong>There is a rounding miscalculation in the borrow function calculation</strong>, which only affects when the attacker is the sole borrower.</li><li><strong>resolveReserve function can increase totalDebt without increasing totalDebtShare</strong> and the function, intended for collecting revenue to the reserve pool, can indeed be called by anyone.</li><li>HomoraBankv2 accepts any custom spell, as long as the invariant checks out that collateral &gt; borrow (a spell is similar to a strategy in Yearn).</li></ul><p>With so many users watching on, the robbers left a clear trail of clues, and in a rare move of counter-aggression, the victims have singled out their attacker.</p><p>The above requirements prove that insider information was required in order to carry out this attack. However, due to the range of protocols and audit firms involved, the insider could have come from several different angles.</p><p><em>rekt is no longer in the business of making accusations, but we look forward to seeing how Alpha Finance handle the situation.</em></p><p><strong>How it happened <a href=""https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-post-mortem/"">according to Alpha Finance:</a></strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> The attacker created an evil spell (equivalent to Yearn’s strategy). <a href=""https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b419173c1f116e94e43afed15a46e3b3a109e118aba166fcca0ba583f686d23"">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b419173c1f116e94e43afed15a46e3b3a109e118aba166fcca0ba583f686d23</a></p><p><strong>2.</strong> Attacker swaps ETH -&gt; UNI, and supplies ETH + UNI to the Uniswap pool (obtaining ETH/UNI LP token). In the same tx, swaps ETH -&gt; sUSD on Uniswap and deposits sUSD to Cream’s Iron Bank (getting cysUSD)
<a href=""https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4441eefe434fbef9d9b3acb169e35eb7b3958763b74c5617b39034decd4dd3ad"">https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4441eefe434fbef9d9b3acb169e35eb7b3958763b74c5617b39034decd4dd3ad</a></p><p><strong>3.</strong> Call execute to HomoraBankV2 using the evil spell (creating position 883), performing:
Borrow 1000e18 sUSD
Deposit UNI-WETH LP to WERC20, and use as collateral (to bypass the collateral &gt; borrow check)
In the process, the attacker has 1000e18 sUSD debt shares (because the attacker is the first borrower)
<a href=""https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcc57ac77dc3953de7832162ea4cd925970e064ead3f6861ee40076aca8e7e571"">https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcc57ac77dc3953de7832162ea4cd925970e064ead3f6861ee40076aca8e7e571</a></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Call execute to HomoraBankV2 using the evil spell again (to position 883), performing:
Repay 1000000098548938710983 sUSD (actual debt with interest accrued is 1000000098548938710984 sUSD), resulting in a repay share of 1 less than the total share.
As a result, the attacker now has 1 minisUSD debt and 1 debt share.

Borrow 19709787742196 minisUSD and transfer to the attacker (doubling each time, since totalDebt doubles each time the borrow is successful). Each borrow is 1 less than the totalDebt value, causing the corresponding borrow share = 0, so the protocol treats this as no debt borrowing.
At the end of tx, the attacker deposits 19.54 sUSD to Cream’s Iron Bank.

Swap 1,800,000 USDC to 1,770,757.56254472419047906 sUSD, and deposit to Cream to have enough liquidity for the attacker to borrow using the custom spell
Continued doubling the sUSD borrow from 1,322.70 sUSD to 677,223.15 sUSD (total of 10 times).
Swap 1,353,123.59 sUSD to 1,374,960.72 USDC on Curve

What’s he been asking you about recently?</em></p><p><strong>Cryptopathic:</strong></p><p>I've filled him in on what exchanges and communities are big for NFTs (Niftygateway, Opensea) and just general info on what new projects pop up.</p><p>I told him about Hashmasks and it seemed to spread like wildfire after he talked about it on Twitter.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>How important do you think that promotion was to the success of Hashmasks?</em></p><p><strong>Cryptopathic:</strong></p><p>I think the sale would have gone on for at least a few more days - the awareness of Hashmasks only spread by word of mouth and the rate they were selling really took off after he talked about it.</p><p>A lot of people look to him for trading advice so when they saw he was getting in on it, it was a good opportunity to make money.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p>OK, enough about him!</p><p><em>You're one of the most respected voices in the NFT space right now.</em></p><p><em>With so much hype, plus the added subjectivity when valuing art-based products, how do you go about assessing the value of early stage NFT projects?</em></p><p><strong>Cryptopathic:</strong></p><p>So the branding and community around something is the most important thing, that or the reputation of the artist, but in early stage projects this may not exist. I heard about masks, for example, from a friend who has been deep into NFTs for a while and had made some good investments, so that gave me some confidence that it would do well. But beyond that, Hashmasks had a very complex system of rarities and a sense of mystery to the whole project, something that hadn't really been done with collectible art NFTs. Not knowing what mask you would get and having all these secrets to be discovered made it really exciting, and also meant as a trader that you could make money by doing research and gaining an information advantage over other people in order to snipe sales of rare masks that may not be so obvious at first glance.</p><p>I think even if there isn't some grand puzzle behind Hashmasks then it's still a winner because the community behind it is huge and it has inspired a lot of people to be interested in NFTs or make their own. That's a ""story"" behind an artwork or collectible, and that's what's really valuable!</p><p>There's going to be a lot of similar projects that pop up, I imagine, but from here on success of new projects will probably depend on if they have an existing franchise behind them. Hashmasks and Cryptopunks have communities that exist around them because they were firsts in some aspects, and it's very easy to copy them, so most copycats will not be able to stick around as the market gets saturated.</p><p>NBA Topshot is doing exceptionally well as one of the only projects with an official brand behind them, and as you have probably heard there are a lot of celebrities jumping in too. Niftygateway have seen some incredible returns on big brand NFTs, with beeple's up 50x or more in many cases. I think you should only buy an NFT if you really like the idea of it, because a lot of them will end up worthless or illiquid, but it will certainly be safer to jump on things that have an existing strong brand behind them.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Alright alright alright, so you're bullish on NFTs we can see that. How do you see the adoption of this technology playing out?</em></p><p><strong>Cryptopathic:</strong></p><p>NBA Topshot for example is a great gateway as people can get in without having to use crypto (and the high fees that come with it!) and they are building their own ecosystem around it, which is really important. It's going to let people use their moments in a mobile app, so they really become luxury goods that people can show off. Stuff like that is really going to make it click for a lot of people. I have been paying attention to NFTs for years but only recently got in for more money as I wasn't confident communities could value them, but the Cryptopunk rise really set this all in motion. Niftygateway is also amazing - while it's centralized, like Topshot, it allows people to buy using credit cards and also has a service to help famous artists make their own NFTs without having to worry about the technicals. It's going to be the Coinbase of NFTs.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>What about the darker side to NFTs?</em></p><p><em>There have been accusations of money laundering, tax evasion and even terrorist financing. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that would you?</em></p><p><strong>Cryptopathic:</strong></p><p>LMAO</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>What's so funny? We want to know if you're using your rare pepes to bankroll ISIS.</em></p><p><strong>Cryptopathic:</strong></p><p>OK OK, you got me.
Money laundering and so on can be done through random altcoins just as well as NFTs, I don't think there is going to be a problem here any more than there is with traditional art.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/02/pepebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>We'll see you around Cryptopathic - any last message for our readers?</em></p><p><strong>Cryptopathic:</strong></p><p>Up only.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Get rekt.</em></p><hr/><p><strong>Despite all the froth and regardless of where the market takes us, the potential for NFTs is huge.</strong> They serve as the perfect medium for tokens which can be art, collectibles, or tools with a defined function.</p><p>Their arrival and inevitable mass adoption will open up unprecedented levels of gamification across multiple industries, benefitting all parties, including the nefarious ones, and considering this isn’t even their final form, the future looks bright for the non-fungible token.</p><p>It’s down to you to find the best way to profit from this emerging asset class, but even if you don’t invest, it will surely be entertaining to watch.</p><blockquote><p>Will the on-chain art industry be different from the traditional, or will we end up forking their corruption as well?</p></blockquote><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/02/conc-NFT.png""/></figure><p></p></section>"

There’s no point in being a maximalist, but it is a shame to see ETH’s market share being taken with such little creativity.</p><p><strong>When Binance <a href=""https://twitter.com/binance/status/1362746733726416898?s=20"">tweeted</a> that they had;</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>Temporarily suspended withdrawals of $ETH and Ethereum-based tokens in order to address a congestion issue.</em></p></blockquote><p>Many were quick to point out that the Ethereum network was actually running fairly well, and that competitor exchanges were facing no such problems.</p><p>Their suspicion was compounded by the fact that Binance have been running a highly <a href=""https://twitter.com/Rewkang/status/1362684628058869766?s=09"">successful</a> promotion campaign for their BSC network, leading some to suggest that this <a href=""https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1362795020538048523?s=09"">""congestion issue""</a> downtime was more promotional than remedial.</p><p>CZ and team are not afraid of <a href=""https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1125996194734399488?s=20"">controversy</a>, and they have worked hard to centralise decentralised finance. Ethereum's high gas fees presented the perfect opportunity for Binance, who have promoted the Binance Smart Chain as an alternative option, using their massive user base as a launchpad.</p><p><strong>The benefits of BSC are obvious, ETH gas fees are too damn <a href=""https://twitter.com/Darrenlautf/status/1363034947695484936?s=20"">high</a>.</strong></p><p>If there’s a cheaper alternative, it will be used.</p><p>Although we see these products from the inside, newcomers won’t see the same way. It’s hard to pitch the presence of a customer service line as a negative to a newcomer who just seeks high APY.</p><p><strong>What’s being planned behind the closed doors of Binance?</strong></p><p><strong>Do they want to compete with Ethereum or work alongside?</strong></p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/calchulus"">Calvin Chu</a> has blocked us on Twitter, so we followed him onto Telegram to ask his opinion.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Do you think increased adoption of products such as Binance Smart Chain will have a negative impact on the adoption of more decentralised products?</em></p><p><strong>Calvin Chu:</strong></p><p>BSC is not the end-all-be-all of chains, and it doesn’t really masquerade as decentralised (despite what some thought leaders may say), but to have an “in-between” sandbox that’s not a testnet but also not a mainnet with mainnet expenses, is actually very helpful for builders and users. Builders can feasibly test in prod, and users can try out new products without paying exorbitant gas fees. If anything, I believe that it whets the appetite for users to go deeper down the defi rabbithole, and could get users to spend more time to DYOR and play around with products they invest in, which helps increase the health of trading and utility across our ecosystem.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Do you think increased adoption of products such as Binance Smart Chain will have a negative impact on the adoption of more decentralised products?</em></p><p><strong>Calvin Chu:</strong></p><p>I think that in the long run, the market will realise the value of decentralisation, and that products that are censorship resistant will command a rightful premium, but if crypto is about giving the power of choice to the user, it should also be about giving users a “freemium” model to dip their toes into defi and learn the ropes without having to pay hundreds of dollars per transaction. Binance for better or worse is a more global, decentralised user base than most dapps, with the 12 languages the website is translated into representing a very diversified audience that is in crypto but not yet necessarily in DeFi.</p><p>If you’re in Argentina, or India, you can’t spend $100 on curve.fi, even if it’s a beautiful smart contract, when that’s a household’s weekly income.</p><p>I believe that in the long run, layer 2s or centralised exchange chains will require further infrastructure to encourage greater liquidity in the cross chain world. With products like xdai’s bridge between ETH/xDAI and xDAI/BSC, to Anyswap’s products across ETH/BSC, etc., the hope is that more products can mesh centralised and decentralised liquidity to most importantly create ultra-deep pockets of permissionless liquidity.</p><p>That is what will allow us to build the best DeFi products of tomorrow.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/02/bsc-gaslinebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>Let’s look at some of the motives for Binance developing their own chain.</strong></p><p>Binance withdrawals account for over <a href=""https://etherscan.io/topstat#Network"">5%</a> of all transactions in the last week on Ethereum.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/02/bsc-topaccountES.png""/></figure><p></p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/ASvanevik/status/1362288014341279744?s=20"">Nansen</a> shows us that Binance spent over $9M in gas fees in a single week.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/02/bsc-nansen-gas.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>Perhaps Binance is simply trying to reduce gas fees for their users...</strong></p><p>As <a href=""https://twitter.com/calchulus/status/1363123887060434945?s=20"">Calvin Chu</a> said on Twitter (apparently);</p><blockquote><p><em>Binance Smart chain allows Binance to wrap and custody mainnet assets that are not as easy to wrap seamlessly onto ETH, or require costly bridges to wrap into smart contract chains. While it's not trustless, it is cheap, and users want to use their assets in smart contracts.</em></p></blockquote><p>According to this <a href=""https://twitter.com/cherry_hotwife/status/1362668102257958914?s=09"">post</a> from Cherry, many new users investigating DeFi find Binance first, and stay there.</p><blockquote><p>I have a lot of friends who are learning about DeFi with BSC. They weren't into crypto 6 months ago. Now they know how to use metamask, bridge tether to bsc, &amp; farm tokens. They aren't playing with big money. But they are learning. They ask me about Bancor,  Curve etc. Let's be honest, ETH is a whale chain now. Still, they are learning, and I see that as a positive for DeFi. Now it’s up to us to give people products they can use without paying kidneys in gas.</p></blockquote><p><strong>We asked Cherry for some more details…</strong></p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Hi Cherry, Your tweet on Feb 19th about BSC adoption was interesting, could you expand on that for us so we can quote you in an upcoming article?</em></p><p><strong>Cherry:</strong></p><p>Sure, well I was trying to point out one positive thing about it lol. Its part of the well built “noobs” ecosystem CZ has made with binance, so, in a bull market at least, its very efficient to onboard people and we can hope that a small % of those people will go into the “real” defi ecosystem more experienced crypto users are in. Because bsc is mostly populated with scams and meme coins and quick cash grabs.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>When your friends start to learn about DeFi, are Binance and BSC one of the first things they find, or do you suggest it to them?</em></p><p><strong>Cherry:</strong></p><p>I never suggested it to anyone no. It's just something I realised. I usually don't bother helping friends get into crypto anymore or I tell them to buy things with good fundamentals like BTC, ETH, LINK. But new people usually look at doge, ada, ""cheap"" coins. When you start in crypto it can be really hard to find the correct information. You fall into the world of shitcoins and follow the herd. They go on binance and buy cheap coins. Then they see a random meme coin pumping hard and they get into farming. BSV looks attractive to them. They might even know it's scammy but some ""invest"" with 50-100$. They couldn't do that on ETH. So I tell them to be careful. But i know they can only learn by themselves and if they gotta get rugged then that's part of the process lol.</p><p><strong>The market for providing a safe space for newcomers is obviously massive.</strong> Binance are catering for this demand, and it seems they are doing it well.</p><p>So we see that the benefits of BSC are obvious, but centralisation often breeds corruption, and Binance still have their doubters.</p><p><strong>We spoke to an anonymous angry bystander, who said;</strong></p><blockquote><p>_I think the Binance congestion is fake af because it doesn't make sense, gas was under 200 at that time. I think CZ was just planning to get more users to go on BSC.</p></blockquote><p>With regards to BSC Hype. I think the volumes are definitely fake but I don't think people really notice that? Like they see on CoinGecko Pancake Swap has higher volume and just assume that Pancake Swap is better than Uniswap._</p><blockquote><p><em>I do think that the cheap fees on BSC are a plus point, my normal friends that come in don't care about decentralization, they just care about profit maximization.</em></p></blockquote><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/02/bsc-bridge.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>The clock is ticking.</strong></p><p>Newcomers are arriving in <a href=""https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/global-crypto-user-index-2021"">greater numbers</a> day by day, and Binance are doing their best to attract and retain these users.

The main pain point is still the on &amp; off boarding of customers onto the L2. High gas fees on entry and wait times on exit mean that customers are reluctant to make the move at the moment without more products on the L2 and easy transfers both within each rollup and to other rollups.</em></p><p><em>The rise of BSC has left a bitter taste in my mouth as we believe that Rollups are the best way forward for scaling DeFi &amp; Ethereum, something that Vitalik agrees with in the short term - Rollups can give low fees, high TPS and even privacy, without sacrificing any of the security benefits of the main Ethereum blockchain. Seeing Binance play games with Ethereum withdrawals and pointing their users towards Binance chain is a smart move on Binance’s part, but is pointing the future of the industry towards a less decentralised and more Binance-centric world. As an industry, we need to focus on CEX-to-L2 transfers to combat the rise of such bad actors and act with our wallets - support your L2 of choice!</em></p></blockquote><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/02/bsc-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>The revolution will be decentralised, but the aftermath won’t be so black and white.</strong></p><p>Corporate chains were inevitable.</p><p><strong>It’s not just Binance.</strong></p><p>Other players are also fighting to house the crypto newcomers by launching their own chain, as shown with the Crypto.com <a href=""https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1363746074482020355?s=20"">mainnet</a>, which is now set to go live on 25th March.</p><p>The resulting blend of CeDeFi will appeal to some who see a corporate name as a security factor.

Frontrunners observe a transaction in the mempool, and send the same transaction with a higher fee, driving up the price of a trade.</p><p>However, even high gas fees aren’t a reliable way to have your transaction processed quickly. Transactions share a common bottleneck: the speed at which they are propagated.</p><p><strong>At its basis, frontrunning is a race: a quick draw, played out on the quicksand of Ethereum’s peer-to-peer network. Frontrunners will pay a premium to play first.</strong></p><p>The first startup to cater to this demand is called bloXroute. It operates a high-speed network inside of Ethereum, that offers customers privileged access to mining pools, and the ability to bypass the heavily armed bots that patrol the mempool.</p><p>bloXroute prioritizes traffic based on how much you pay, with priority given to the highest paying customer.

<strong>Beeple is out and who can blame him?</strong><p></p><p>Well, perhaps those who paid millions in ETH for his artwork, or maybe those who promoted him as a figurehead for the NFT industry.</p><p>Beeple made his money off the NFT boom, but his art has been around much longer. He started his ""everydays"" in May 2007, and has not missed a day <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/78g539/beeple-cgi-master-10-years-everydays-results"">since.</a></p><p>After selling the proceeds of his work ""5000 days"" ($59 million of ETH into USD), it’s highly likely that it was Beeple who caused the price to dump, but is what he did unfair?</p><p>For a non-investor, especially one who is new to crypto, the price swings on a portfolio of $59 million must have been concerning. Beeple could be right in his belief that the NFT industry is “in a bubble”, so how could people think that he has done something wrong?</p><p>If Beeple buyers were in it for the art, then why would they care what he does with the proceeds? It wasn’t Beeple who set the high prices on his work, and he doesn’t shill or over-promote.</p><p><strong>The community was short-sighted to believe that Beeple was “in it for the tech”, especially as he publicly stated;</strong></p><blockquote><p>“I’m not remotely a crypto-purist. I was making digital art long before any of this shit, and if all this fucking NFT stuff went away tomorrow I would still be making digital art,”</p></blockquote><p>Surely that is the attitude we need from digital artists? Not cheap rip offs of Cryptopunks from anons who are just looking to make profit, but genuine contributions from passionate artists. Of course it’s a shame that Beeple didn’t decide to stay in crypto, both for market participants, and for his own personal wealth, as he could easily have used that 59 million to provide liquidity in stablecoins and use his earnings much more efficiently.</p><p><strong>He could at least have converted some to USD stables...</strong></p><p>The Ethereum community supported Beeple, and without ETH he would not have made his millions, so it would have been nice to see him interact more with the community after making his millions, but his actions are nothing compared to what we do to each other; with the rug pulling, hacking and scamming.</p><p><strong>Will this mark the end of the NFT craze?</strong></p><p>Probably not; as although the echo chamber might suggest that the craze began to die down two weeks ago, the mainstream media is just getting started.</p><p>Art is only one subset of what NFTs can be, and the potential profit will not be ignored.</p><p>Several Bitcoin market cycles and over a year of intense innovation in decentralised finance, but it is non fungible tokens that caught the eye of the public, as they relate to a much more widespread set of interests.</p><p>Most people are not interested in financial investing, trading, or decentralisation, but nearly everyone can find something they enjoy in the world of NFTs.</p><p><em>What will happen to the valuations of Beeples work now he has shown where his interests lie?</em></p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-text-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p></section>"

These models work well, but the decentralised versions are capital inefficient, and put the underlying assets at risk. The adoption of these coins is also somewhat limited due to the required overcollateralisation.</p><p>Projects such as <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ampleforth"">Ampleforth</a> and <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/empty-set-dollar"">Empty Set Dollar</a> attempted to create sovereign stable currencies without relying on any collateral, however, the coins they created were far from stable.</p><p>Arguably the most successful decentralised stablecoin protocol is Maker <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai"">(DAI)</a> which relies on user-owned collateral to create a non volatile decentralised asset. However, it’s not perfect; it is <a href=""https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484"">impossible</a> to execute closed cycle arbitrage for DAI, so the price is not entirely  stable, and the protocol faces scaling issues.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/04/fei-collateral.png""/></figure>

Along with ESD 1.5 and multichain concepts such as Frax, Fei represents part of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/Rewkang/status/1377330694389559299?s=20"">second</a> major wave of algo stablecoins. Although the launch of Fei was far from perfect, and cast doubt over the future success of the project, it’s easy to see why people are still pushing to conceive what could be considered the “immaculate stablecoin”.</p><p>FEI used a bonding curve and “direct incentives” token model in an attempt to;</p><blockquote><p>maintain a liquid market in which ETH/FEI trades at approximately the ETH/USD price.</p></blockquote><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/04/fei-burnmint.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>During the much hyped Token Genesis Event, users were able to mint FEI from the ETH bonding curve for up to a 50% discount.</strong> This also made them eligible for an airdrop of the protocol governance token TRIBE, which seemed to represent an appealing opportunity for many, as over 17,000 unique addresses participated in the event.</p><p>This advertised discount would turn out to be just the first of many pieces of bad news for the Fei Protocol. The terms and conditions of the discount meant that participants would only get this discount if under $250m in ETH was contributed. As $1.3B in ETH was collected at launch, this discount was taken away, and the ETH was irreversibly given to the project for their “Protocol Controlled Value” model, which;</p><blockquote><p>gives the protocol more flexibility to engage in activities that are not profit-oriented.</p></blockquote><p>The entirety of this PCV was initially used to build liquidity on Uniswap.</p><p>At one point, the Uniswap FEI/ETH pool had over $2.6B in liquidity, created from the ETH raised during the initial sale.</p><p>However, these numbers mean nothing in regards to the success of the project, as FEI then rapidly lost its peg and its reputation along with it.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/04/fei-cg.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>What went wrong?</strong></p><p>The initial peg was lost mainly due to the “pre-swap” option allowing participants to automatically swap their FEI tokens for TRIBE upon launch, which created millions of dollars of selling pressure.</p><p>The Fei protocol punishes those who sell FEI and reward those who buy it whenever it is below the peg. Because approximately 98% of the liquidity for TRIBE comes from the TRIBE-FEI pair, users who wish to sell their TRIBE for ETH will either be forced to take a punishment for selling FEI as they are routed through the TRIBE-FEI pair, or lose equal sums to slippage from the low liquidity of the TRIBE-ETH pair.</p><p>Matters were made worse when, despite audits from <a href=""https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/01/fei-protocol/"">Consensys Diligence</a> and <a href=""https://blog.openzeppelin.com/fei-protocol-audit/"">Open Zeppelin</a>, a “vulnerability was found in the incentive calculation” of Fei.

If you punish the sellers, you're also punishing the buyers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The penalty mechanism in FEI not only makes the supply disappear, it also makes demand disappear.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>It punishes both sides, and thereby narrows the feasibility envelope for the coin.</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Making the effective price lower when the price is low is exactly the opposite of what you want in an algorithmic stablecoin!</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/04/fei-brianna.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>When one of the Fei founders was seen to suggest allocating some of the PCV to Yearn, the idea was criticised on <a href=""https://twitter.com/DefiDuck_Karoo/status/1379631539978436612"">Twitter</a>, as Karoo joked;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Our project isn't quite going as planned, so why don't we at least get some yield on all this eth you gave us.</p></blockquote><p>And Banteg said in a public group;</p><blockquote><p>Personally I’d vehemently want them to dismantle and refund their users, even if it means not deploying +50% tvl to Yearn.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We don't decide who uses the protocol.

Yet even the most hard-working investors soon grew tired of wading through endless <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/hathor-public-files/hathor-white-paper.pdf"">historical accounts</a> about Bitcoin’s ledger size or the double spending problem.</p><p>As the frenzy grew, the quality dropped, yet the document length remained the same.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://dentacoin.com/assets/uploads/whitepaper.pdf"">Thirty pages</a> were needed to explain how the dental industry could be revolutionised by crypto currency.</strong></p><p>Technical content turned into pure marketing, and celebrity advisors were shipped in to add authenticity.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20180518182304/http://pinktaxi.io/pdf/whitepaper.pdf"">Thirty six pages</a> (and an endorsement by John McAfee) was enough to convince some investors that blockchain was the solution for women’s economic empowerment when using a taxi.</strong></p><p>The <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0ZDaBQx4ghkdX5IUwZb1n8ThvYf7i22MSt9Gm00JRU/edit"">HEX</a> whitepaper even provided readers with an ETH address for sending tips.</p><p>Vapourware and empty promises only last so long, and eventually the market imploded, marking the start of what would be a long and brutal crypto winter in which only bears could survive.</p><p><strong>As portfolios crashed, perceived value melted away, and readers would come to realise that even the strongest whitepaper holds no value.</strong></p><p>When we finally emerged, the once fertile lands were empty.

<strong>A new season.</strong><p></p><p>The whitepaper is gone, but little is lost. Working products have taken its place.</p><p>In 2017 our attention was divided, different chains had different claims but few had many users.</p><p><strong>It’s not just developers who “test in prod”.</strong></p><p>Even the most minimally viable product can find a home in today's market, where protocols are launched without delay. Community governance feeds the on-chain evolution, as projects continue to grow and define themselves post-launch.</p><p>Governance suggests that the users of a product decide the direction of its evolution, yet token distribution normally means that the founders hold most of the supply.</p><p><strong>Although the community has some say, the developer's voice still speaks loudest; an aspect not entirely true to decentralised ideals, however it does not mean they can do as they please.</strong></p><p>Owners know if they make unpopular decisions, then their protocol will be forked and the other route taken.</p><p><strong>Anonymous teams develop without downtime, transforming untrustworthy forks into “blue chip” products.</strong></p><p>The ERC-20 ushered in an era of quick launch and rapid iteration. Trends come and go within days. Forks upon forks of unaudited code build houses of cards that hold excessive rewards.</p><p>Roadmaps remain, but the fantastical projections of old white papers are nowhere to be seen; replaced by straight talking Medium <a href=""https://medium.com/iearn/yfi-df84573db81"">posts</a> that achieve equal status.

<strong>Truth can be stranger than fiction…</strong><p></p><p>If the <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/truebit-protocol"">TrueBit</a> launch wasn’t a scam, then why was there so much <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n3eib4/truebit_apparently_did_a_stealth_launch_its/"">suspicion?</a></p><p>With no official media channels or any form of up to date launch announcement, there is still much we don’t know about the mysterious launch of TrueBit protocol.</p><p>According to the <a href=""https://truebit.substack.com/p/truebit-early-access"">Substack post</a> released on April 20th, the purpose of TrueBit is to “enable smart contracts to securely perform complex computations in standard programming languages at reduced gas costs.”</p><p><strong>The positive impact of such a project would be <em>big if true</em>, so why was the launch so unusual, and what made people so skeptical?</strong></p><p><strong>1:</strong> Many were concerned that there had been little recent development considering the protocol was suddenly live, but it turned out that the project has two Github accounts - TruebitProtocol and the more developed TrueBitFoundation.</p><p><strong>2:</strong> TrueBit's official Medium didn’t clearly state a token contract, which led some to believe that the launch contract could be an imposter. However, the contract address can be found in the FAQ section of their website.</p><p><strong>3:</strong> The most recent communication from TrueBit was their announcement that the mainnet went live on April 26th. Leading up to this there had been no Twitter activity from the team since Jan 25th.</p><p><strong>4:</strong> The absence of any official Telegram or Discord for the project.</p><p>Considering all the above points, plus the extreme level of hype and shilling during the token sale, it’s understandable that people would become suspicious.</p><p>As Banteg wrote on <a href=""https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1389032239162347521?s=20"">Twitter</a>;</p><blockquote><p>The protocol soft launched with a limited access to the codebase, only a few people figured out how to arb the bonding curve contract.

Also, a TrueBit mention from Vitalik in an <a href=""https://ethresear.ch/t/evm-optimistic-rollup-using-truebit/9318"">ethresear.ch</a> post further fuelled the FOMO.</p><p><strong>Stealth or Surprise?</strong></p><p>Although the founders had always planned a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4QSzzQDdus&amp;t=2594s"">stealth</a> launch for the project, it’s been days now since the token went live, and a great deal of uncertainty remains.</p><p>Was this another rogue deployment like <a href=""https://stakecapital.substack.com/p/crv-outta-nowhere"">$CRV?</a> Did the team want somebody to deploy for them or did someone gain access to their private repo, forcing them to accept the launch as official?</p><p>The only communication from TrueBit has been a <a href=""https://twitter.com/Truebitprotocol/status/1389413359909445634?s=20"">tweet</a> stating that they are planning a Q&amp;A session soon, something which the confused $TRU buyers will be happy to hear.</p><p>The scant information available on the token sale led many to believe that a bonding curve was used, and that it failed to maintain the price. However, the team made no mention of any bonding curve, and this was simply a misunderstanding of the mint/burn process used by TrueOS in the sale.</p><p>Users can interact with the TrueOS smart contract to mint new TRU tokens from their ETH, however, as more tokens are brought into circulation, minting becomes more expensive.</p><p>TRU tokens can also be sold back to TrueOS, which buys the tokens at 12.5% of the highest minting price and then burns them.</p><p>All was going well until the hype turned to fear on May 2nd when the token price suddenly crashed after 24 hours of consecutive green candles.</p><p>One TRU whale had removed their liquidity and <a href=""https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfc0d844aa186430d13817c996dddde1633b35ab1b6145cc4d7d9b33d58d10d6f"">market sold</a> $465,000 of $TRU.

<strong>Layer two is here, and apps are scaling fast.</strong><p></p><p>They say life on the second layer is a huge improvement, but how long will it last? What will become of these rollups and sidechains once the Ethereum mainnet catches up?</p><p>What is Layer two, what do we know about the solutions that are being offered, and is everything as safe as it seems?</p><p>Although other more centralised chains may have faster transactions or reduced fees, the challenge for Ethereum comes with maintaining decentralisation and security whilst improving scalability. “L2” is a collective term for solutions designed to help scale Ethereum applications by handling transactions off the main Ethereum chain (L1).</p><p>There are several different projects offering their solutions to the problem, but some are growing much faster than others.</p><p>One L2 solution that has become very popular in recent weeks is <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon"">Polygon</a> (formerly known as Matic); an aggregator of scaling solutions for Ethereum. Instead of focusing on one solution, such as Optimistic rollups (used by Synthetix), Polygon plans to incorporate them all.</p><p>Big names in DeFi such as Aave, Curve, and Stake DAO are using Polygon to cut transaction times and fees for their users.</p><p>Users can deposit Ethereum tokens to a Polygon bridge smart contract, interact with them within the Polygon sidechain, and then later withdraw them back to the Ethereum main chain. In this way users retain the security of Ethereum whilst avoiding the high transaction fees that have been brought on by its increased volume.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/04/second-futurehold.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>It’s easy to imagine that an upgraded Ethereum 2.0 would remove the need for L2 solutions.</strong> However, in a recent interview with <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/polygons-ethereum-scaling-sandeep-nailwal"">Coindesk</a>, Polygon founder Sandeep Nailwal explained why he believes Eth 2.0 does not signal the end for Polygon network.</p><blockquote><p>Ethereum 2.0 is supposed to have 64 shards, each one is going to be similar to what Ethereum is today. Let’s say after you add proof-of-stake to the current, single Ethereum chain, it’s able to process 50 tps (transactions per second), up from <a href=""https://blockchair.com/ethereum/charts/transactions-per-second"">13 tps</a> today. Multiply that 64 shards: 3,200 tps.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Do you think if Ethereum is going to become the fundamental settlement layer of the world that even 3,200 tps is a good enough scalability?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ethereum 2.0 will become 64 times more scalable than Ethereum is now, but the demand is 1,000 X than where we are. You will need L2 scalability.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Of course, not everyone will share Sandeep’s vision</strong></p><p>Perhaps 3200 transactions per second will be sufficient for enough time that people will stop using L2 solutions. Maybe when we do need more than 3200 tps, we’ll be using Ethereum 3.0…</p><p><a href=""https://fuellabs.medium.com/the-future-of-l1-ethereum-5ec5d9a01c10"">Others</a> also predict that Ethereum will rely on multiple layers for the long-term, and expect L1 to be a place for base issuance and settlement of protocol assets, and L2 for microtransactions and enabling censorship resistance or enforcement.</p><p>In this scenario, core assets and contracts can be deployed on L1, then an L2 can be used for dispersal of tokens, analogous contracts or related systems.</p><p><strong>However the L1-L2 relationship plays out, the main event is without a doubt, the launch, or “merge” of ETH 2.0.</strong></p><p>The launch process for Eth 2.0 started on December 1st 2020, with the launch of The beacon chain, which introduced proof-of-stake to Ethereum and allowed developers to set  up for the second upgrade - shard chains.</p><p><a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/"">Ethereum.org</a> states that;</p><blockquote><p>Eth2 researchers are working on ways to accelerate the merge. It will probably happen earlier than expected.</p></blockquote><p>The website goes on to explain;</p><blockquote><p>Shards will give Ethereum more capacity to store and access data, but they won’t be used for executing code.<strong>The details of that are still being figured out.</strong></p></blockquote><p>It’s sentences such as this which remind us how early we are in the life of this technology.</p><p>When the internet was becoming popular, many people expected it to be another media channel; expecting a future where there would be TV and radio, plus the internet. In the end, the internet engulfed it all. The same will happen with crypto. It won’t just be cryptocurrencies.</p><p>L2 and Eth 2.0 will open the door to the biggest casino on earth. What we’re seeing now on BSC is nothing compared to what is to come.</p><p>The coming boom of crypto day traders and full-time yield farmers might make the taxman nervous, and certain protocols will grow their market capitalisation to unprecedented, powerful sums. Fast, secure, and nearly free transactions will finally make the use of crypto for microtransactions and daily purchases a reality, further accelerating the growth of our alternate economy.</p><p>The cross chain competition will be fierce, as Eth 2.0 is not short of technically advanced and well-funded competitors such as Solana, Avalanche, or Elrond.</p><p>The first mover advantage is incredibly strong in cryptocurrency, but this industry changes quickly, and Ethereum has not yet won the race.</p><p>However, there won’t be just one winner. It’s likely that the future of finance will be cross chain, as different protocols will focus their efforts on certain aspects, such as speed, security, privacy or decentralisation, creating a competitive market and giving users the option to choose.</p><p>As we enter the second layer, we can look back and see the astounding progress that has been made, despite the harsh constraints of high gas costs and low transactions per second.</p><p>As the hurdles start lowering more and more and people grow accustomed to the idea of using crypto in their daily lives, it is very hard to not be excited by what is being built.</p><p><strong>As was written in the <a href=""https://www.rekt.news/hopium-diaries-dystopian-dreams/"">Hopium Diaries</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>This industry and the desire for financial freedom is not going away, the only uncertainty is how, not if, we will arrive at our goal of mass adoption. The cost of transactions must decrease and TPS must increase, but it is only a matter of time before this happens, and when it does, the opportunity is gone.</p></blockquote><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/04/second-conc2.png""/></figure><p></p></section>"

It’s been two days now since the bug was found, how has the incident affected you and your team?</em></p><p><strong>Scoopy:</strong></p><p>It's been stressful, but thankfully we have had a lot of support from our community and people all over the industry. We are confident in our ability to get alETH solvent again, and we are extremely fortunate that no user lost funds in this incident. Going forward our team will exercise an even greater abundance of caution in all areas of our operation. We realize that protocols are lucky to get second chances, and almost never get third chances. Our team is committed to being better and learning from our mistakes so we never repeat them.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Alchemix had over <a href=""https://defillama.com/protocol/alchemix"">$1b TVL</a> at the time of the incident, that’s a lot of responsibility - can you give us some insight into how you felt when you were alerted to the issue?</em></p><p><strong>Scoopy:</strong></p><p>Having such a high tvl comes with an incredible burden. When we first realized something was wrong, the first thing we did was to pause the contracts. Constant worry filled my mind and it felt like my blood was on fire as we researched in the war room to find the root cause. We found relief when we got to the answer and realized all funds were safe, but still knew we had a lot of work to make things right.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Alchemix made a public appeal for users to return the withdrawn funds - how successful has that been?</em></p><p><strong>Scoopy:</strong></p><p>We have had many in the community say they will do it but we have not yet started the program. We will have a portal up on our app page in a few days where users can voluntarily return their free eth or alETH. We will see how far that gets us, and are weighing several options for how to cover whatever doesn't get returned. We'll be sure to include community feedback in whatever course of action we end up taking.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>How many users took the opportunity to withdraw “free” ETH?</em></p><p><strong>Scoopy:</strong></p><p>In the end, it will be anyone who borrowed alETH. The bug repaid all the debt, so even those who wish not to exploit this incident have no choice but to.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>How will the missing $6.5m affect the future development of the protocol?</em></p><p><strong>Scoopy:</strong></p><p>It all depends on how much our users give back. If we get &gt; 25% of it, our treasury's non-ALCX holdings of approx $4m will be able to cover it. It will mean we will not be able to be as aggressive in hiring and marketing for some time, but we will recover since we have good cash flow. If we have a more tepid response to the voluntary returning program, then we will explore further measures  to make it solvent. We have been offered help from many in the space, so we have some solid options.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Thanks Scoopy. Any final message for our readers?</em></p><p><strong>Scoopy:</strong></p><p>We are conducting an internal review to ensure we can eliminate mistakes and errors. We thank the DeFi community for all the support and will move forward more battled-hardened and wiser.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/06/alcx-linebreak.png""/></figure>

Not-so-automated approach works for stablecoin/stablecoin trades, but for volatile pairs it's extremely challenging.</p><p>Numbers show that vaults meant to automate Uv3 liquidity management lose money if you compare to ""fee-less Uniswap2"" which means they are highly suboptimal.</p><p>So we will probably strike back on a more volatile front (that requires a lot of optimization work which is happening currently)</p><p>As for stablecoin/stablecoin pairs - Uniswap currently benefits from the fact that it is very well known to users who have no idea about dex aggregators.

It's a privileged contract that has the right to trigger messages from another chain. It's a standard thing for cross-chain projects.</strong></p><p>It has a function named <strong>verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx</strong> that anyone can call to execute a cross-chain transaction.</p><p>It (1) verifies that the block header is correct by checking signatures (seems the other chain was a poa sidechain or) and then (2) checks that the transaction was included within that block with a Merkle proof. <a href=""https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/d16252b2b857eecf8e558bd3e1f3bb14cff30e9b/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/logic/EthCrossChainManager.sol#L127"">Here's the code.</a></p><p>One of the last things the function does is call <strong>executeCrossChainTx</strong>, which makes the call to the target contract. This is where the critical flaw sits. <a href=""https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/d16252b2b857eecf8e558bd3e1f3bb14cff30e9b/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/logic/EthCrossChainManager.sol#L185"">Poly checks</a> that the target is a contract, but they forgot to prevent users from calling a very important target... the <a href=""https://github.com/polynetwork/eth-contracts/blob/master/contracts/core/cross_chain_manager/data/EthCrossChainData.sol""><strong>EthCrossChainData</strong> contract</a></p><p>By sending this cross-chain message, the user could trick the <strong>EthCrossChainManager</strong> into calling the <strong>EthCrossChainData</strong> contract, passing the <strong>onlyOwner</strong> check. Now the user just had to craft the right data to be able to trigger the function that changes the public keys…</p><p>The only remaining challenge was to figure out how to make the <strong>EthCrossChainManager</strong> call the right function. Now comes a little bit of complexity around how Solidity picks which function you're trying to call.</p><p>The first four bytes of transaction input data is called the ""signature hash"" or ""sighash"" for short. It's a short piece of information that tells a Solidity contract what you're trying to do.</p><p>The sighash of a function is calculated by taking the first four bytes of the hash of ""<!-- -->&lt;function name&gt;<!-- -->(<!-- -->&lt;function input types&gt;<!-- -->)"". For example, the sighash of the ERC20 transfer function is the first four bytes of the hash of ""transfer(address,uint256)"".</p><p>Poly's contract was willing to call any contract. However, it would only call the contract function that corresponded to the following sighash:</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/poly-sighash.png""/></figure><p></p><p>Errr but wait... <strong>""_method""</strong> here was user input. All the attacker had to do to call the right function was figure out <em>some</em> value for ""<strong>_method</strong>"" that, when combined with those other values and hashed, had the same leading four bytes as the sighash of our target function.</p><p>With just a little bit of grinding, you can easily find some input that produces the right sighash. You don't need to find a full hash collision, you're only checking the first four bytes. So is this theory correct?</p><p>Well... here's the actual sighash of the target function:</p><blockquote><p><a href=""http://ethers.utils.id"">http://ethers.utils.id</a> ('putCurEpochConPubKeyBytes(bytes)').slice(0, 10)</p></blockquote><p>'0x41973cd9'</p><p>And the sighash that the attacker crafted...</p><blockquote><p><a href=""http://ethers.utils.id"">http://ethers.utils.id</a> ('f1121318093(bytes,bytes,uint64)').slice(0, 10)</p></blockquote><p>'0x41973cd9'</p><p><strong>Fantastic. No private key compromise required! Just craft the right data and boom... the contract will just hack itself!</strong></p><p>One of the biggest design lessons that people need to take away from this is: if you have cross-chain relay contracts like this, <strong>MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN'T BE USED TO CALL SPECIAL CONTRACTS.</strong> The <strong>EthCrossDomainManager</strong> shouldn't have owned the <strong>EthCrossDomainData</strong> contract.</p><p>Separate concerns. If your contract absolutely needs to have special privileges like this, make sure that users can't use cross-chain messages to call those special contracts.""</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><blockquote><p>On the Ethereum blockchain, the hacker stole</p></blockquote><p><strong>USDC</strong> - 96,389,444</p><p><strong>WBTC</strong> - 1,032</p><p><strong>DAI</strong> - 673,227</p><p><strong>UNI</strong> - 43,023</p><p><strong>SHIBA</strong> - 259,737,345,149</p><p><strong>renBTC</strong>- 14.47</p><p><strong>USDT</strong> - 33,431,197</p><p><strong>wETH</strong> - 26,109</p><p><strong>FEI USD</strong> - 616,082</p><blockquote><p>On BSC, the hacker stole:</p></blockquote><p><strong>BNB</strong> - 6,613.44</p><p><strong>USDC</strong> - 87,603,373</p><p><strong>ETH</strong> - 299</p><p><strong>BTCB</strong> - 26,629</p><p><strong>BUSD</strong> - 1,023</p><blockquote><p>On the Polygon blockchain, the hacker stole:</p></blockquote><p><strong>USDC</strong> - 85,089,610</p><blockquote><p>TOTAL VALUE LOST - ~$611,000,000</p></blockquote><p><em>At the time of writing, the stolen funds are located in the following wallets:</em></p><p><strong>ETH:</strong> <a href=""https://etherscan.io/address/0xC8a65Fadf0e0dDAf421F28FEAb69Bf6E2E589963"">0xC8a65Fadf0e0dDAf421F28FEAb69Bf6E2E589963</a></p><p><strong>BSC:</strong> <a href=""https://bscscan.com/address/0x0D6e286A7cfD25E0c01fEe9756765D8033B32C71"">0x0D6e286A7cfD25E0c01fEe9756765D8033B32C71</a></p><p><strong>Polygon:</strong> <a href=""https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5dc3603C9D42Ff184153a8a9094a73d461663214"">0x5dc3603C9D42Ff184153a8a9094a73d461663214</a></p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>DeFi storylines are rarely straightforward, and this one is no exception.</strong></p><p><em>Even anonymous actors adore attention.</em></p><p>Shortly after the exploit, an unexpected protagonist appeared, going by the name of <a href=""https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8b5c45c6388c9ee12546061786026aaeaa4b682"">hanashiro.eth.</a></p><p>hanashiro.eth first gained attention when they <a href=""https://etherscan.io/tx/0xae2442c5b5721df8c190fd8f59b53b6dc56a875fb03035ad34276a598ddf7d31"">sent the hacker</a> a tip about how to handle USDT, for which they <a href=""https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdf3afc47c7914e06ddb1be19afcd769e558111d353e55273a62c4a96e6a6090f"">received 13.37 Ether</a> from the hacker as a reward.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/JustDoingItBig/status/1425115724209655812?s=20"">Many others</a> sent messages to the hacker afterwards, but none were quite as successful as hanashiro.eth.</strong></p><p>With a truly crypto native level of philanthropic showmanship, hanashiro.eth went on to donate their stolen money to a few of the foundational organisations which support our industry, such as Infura, Etherscan, and <a href=""https://www.rekt.news/"">rekt.news</a>.</p><p><em>But not all of the funds were so freely accessible.</em></p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1425090760609832978?s=20"">Tether froze all of the 33M USDT</a> that were stolen on the Ethereum chain.</p><p><strong>Their coin - their choice… A fact worth remembering if you use USDT.</strong></p><p>By this point the shit had really hit the fan; and all eyes were on <a href=""https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425123153009803267"">Poly Network, who resorted to posting an open letter</a> to the attacker begging them to return the funds.</p><p><strong>A single tweet asking a criminal to return six hundred million dollars...

I think it's a fun story about how crypto is always going to be related to some real life point of trust even though it's all (mostly) cryptographically secure. I'm happy the hackers returned the funds and actually really liked the art!</p><p>Is there a reason I was contacted for this?</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>We’ve been told that on August 25th; the last time the Banksy website was hacked, it showed a link to your instagram profile.</em></p><p><em>Why is that?</em></p><p><strong>samwcyo:</strong></p><p>I had tried to disclose a vulnerability to them, I don't think it has been fixed yet. I sent a bunch of emails after finding something but wasn't able to get in contact with anyone. Hopefully it's been fixed now, but haven't heard back from anyone.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if someone else had found the vulnerability. It was really simple and really bad. I guess it makes sense that someone had hacked the website, but I am glad that the people who did hack it didn't do it maliciously and played what looks to be just a massive prank.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Have you ever had any communication with Pranksy?</em></p><p><strong>samwcyo:</strong></p><p>No, I followed them on Twitter recently trying to get in contact with Banksy.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>He was following you, until today.

This allows for the internal rebalancing of assets within the pool on a constant product curve.</p><p>The function <em>extrapolatePoolValueFromToken</em> is based on the <em>“first token in the pool with a target weight over 0 and which is fully initialized”</em> to calculate the total value of the pool.</p><blockquote><p>total_value = token_balance * total_weight / token_weight</p></blockquote><p><strong>In order to control slippage, the rate at which the resulting changes in weights are enacted within the pool is <a href=""https://docs.indexed.finance/index-pool-protocol/index"">limited</a>, creating a temporary discrepancy ripe for manipulation.</strong></p><p><strong>The attacker’s address was funded via Tornado Cash hours before the attack:</strong>

Since every component of Indexed is open-source, we answered these questions, and upon asking the reason, were told that they were attempting to create an arbitrage bot for the pools.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is a key part of how Indexed generates revenue (exit fees on burns when arbitraging the NAV of tokens and their value on DEXes), and we were happy to engage with queries about the mechanics, explaining how reindexes work, the timing of reweights, how tokens are added and removed from candidate asset lists, and so on. We had no reason to be alarmed: all of these conversations were in the spirit of open-source collaboration.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are aware (courtesy of <a href=""https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio"">@pcaversaccio</a>) that the exploiter requested some Kovan testnet Ether via Gitter, using the (dead, presumably created for the purposes of the assault) Twitter account @ZetaZeroes.

href=""https://medium.com/superfluid-blog/08-02-22-exploit-post-mortem-15ff9c97cdd"">Superfluid’s own post-mortem.</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>Vulnerability Explanation</strong></p><p>Superfluid.sol, known as the host contract, is the contract that allows composable Superfluid agreements <em>(ConstantFlowAgreement, InstantDistributionAgreement)</em> in one single transaction, and the composed systems are often called Super Apps.</p><p>However, in order to have a trusted and shared state through the entire transaction between different agreement calls, a concept called <em>“ctx”</em> (a serialized state managed by the host contract) is introduced.</p><p>The “ctx” contains all the context an agreement function needs to know, that includes especially who is the <em>“msg.sender”</em> of the initial call.</p><p>That’s where an unfortunate vulnerability was exploited.</p><p><strong>The attacker was able to skillfully craft the calldata such that the process of serialization in the host contract and succeeding de-serialization in the agreement contract resulted in the agreement contract operating on a context object forged specifically to impersonate other accounts.</strong></p><p>This mechanism was used in order to create IDA indexes “on behalf” of other accounts and move out their tokens that way.</p><p><strong>The Exploiter Contract:</strong></p><p>The following exploiter contract demonstrates how the vulnerability could be used to impersonate other accounts to close their open streams.</p><p>In the actual <a href=""https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x396b6ee91216cf6e7c89f0c6044dfc97e84647f5007a658ca899040471ab4d67"">exploit transaction</a>, the attacker used the IDA contract to drain funds from other accounts using the same technique:</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/02/superfluid-badcall-code.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>Chain of Function Calls</strong></p><p><strong>deleteAnyFlowBad</strong></p><p>The convention to callAgreement is to use the placeholder ctx, so that later agreement solidity code can read it directly as an argument “ctx”.</p><p><em>To read more about this concept, see <a href=""https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/wiki/About-Placeholder-Ctx"">About-Placeholder-Ctx</a>.</em></p><p>This is where the attacker managed to inject a faked “ctx”, where an arbitrary sender could be set.</p><p><strong>Superfluid.callAgreement</strong></p><p>In the normal case, Superfluid.callAgreement creates the ctx and puts a stamp on it (stores its hash in a state variable), such that it can be validated using <em>Superfluid.isCtxValid.</em></p><p><strong>ConstantFlowAgreementV1.createFlow</strong></p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/02/superfluid-createflow-code.png""/></figure><p></p><p>The agreement then uses AgreementLibrary.authorizeTokenAccess to verify that the calling host contract is authorized to do state modifying calls on the token contract.</p><p><strong>AgreementLibrary.authorizeTokenAccess</strong></p><p>Once the calling host is authenticated, the agreement would transitively also trust the handed over ctx and decode (de-serialize) it into a memory structure.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/02/superfluid-authorize-code.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>But Fake Ctx!</strong></p><p>The problem was that as in the exploiting function <em>deleteAnyFlowBad</em>, one can inject a fake ctx.</p><p>After being merged into one bytes object by <em>Superfluid.replacePlaceholderCtx</em> (the Host doesn’t make any assumptions about agreement specific data), the resulting <em>dataWithCtx</em> now contains 2 ctx variants, the legitimate one and the injected one.</p><p><strong>When the agreement contract decodes this data, the abi decoder takes the first (injected) variant and ignores the remaining data which contains the legitimate ctx.</strong></p><p>In order to solve this, Superfluid added a verification step in the agreement contract:</p><p><em>ISuperfluid.isCtxValid.</em> This verifies the decoded ctx by comparing its stamp (hash) stored in the host contract.</p><p>This check was already in place for handling ctx data provided by SuperApp callbacks, but was not in place for data handed over by the trusted Host contract.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>Superfluid has reached out to the attacker <a

the return of the funds.</strong></p><p>The team also states that most of the affected accounts have already been refunded, while the larger QI and MOCA losses will be compensated more gradually.</p><p>Although this was not the largest exploit <em>(number 42 on <a href=""https://rekt.news/leaderboard/"">our leaderboard</a>)</em>, and no user funds were lost, it is notable for the manner in which it affected other protocols.</p><p>The growing area of DAO infrastructure presents more targets for the anonymous attackers who are so prevalent in DeFi.</p><p><strong>The stolen money still sits in the attackers wallet.</strong></p><p><em>Will they take the bounty, or leave Superfluid high and dry?</em></p></section>"

despite the fact that total losses were already known to be <a href=""https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1467310381073047552"">~$196M</a>, a figure that BitMart continues to use in its official <a

unlimited approvals to an EOA, as in Celsius’ case.</p><p>These are understandable mistakes when it comes to individuals and smaller balances. But at this level it’s hard to forgive, especially when CeFi represents the corrupt legacy financial system cashing in on the innovation of DeFi.</p><p>A Cayman-registered corporation has lost close to $200M. Their communications team first denied and then downplayed the losses. All this while freezing withdrawals until out of the news cycle, when the fear of a “bank run” has subsided.</p><p><strong>Do these middlemen deserve to take a profit?</strong></p><p><em>And if they insist on doing so, will BitMart at least commit to refunding their users?</em></p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png""/></figure><p></p><blockquote><p><em>If you enjoy our work, please consider donating to our <a href=""https://gitcoin.co/grants/1632/rekt-the-dark-web-of-defi-journalism"">Gitcoin Grant</a></em></p></blockquote></section>"

This lets them mount high-quality social engineering attacks that look like totally normal interactions. A document sent from one colleague to another on a topic, which is currently being discussed, is unlikely to trigger any suspicion. BlueNoroff compromises companies through precise identification of the necessary people and the topics they are discussing at a given time.”</p></blockquote><p>Yesterday’s <a href=""https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-108a"">CISA report</a> provides:</p><blockquote><p><em>information on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to stakeholders in the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency industry to help them identify and mitigate cyber threats against cryptocurrency.</em>”</p></blockquote><p>It describes a series of malicious applications that are delivered via the spearphishing to employees disguised as “<em>trading or price prediction tools</em>”.</p><blockquote><p>Observed payloads include updated macOS and Windows variants of Manuscrypt, a custom remote access trojan (RAT), that collects system information and has the ability to execute arbitrary commands and download additional payloads (see <a href=""https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/analysis-reports/ar20-133a"">North Korean Remote Access Tool: COPPERHEDGE</a>).

<strong>TICKET TOUT TIED UP IN CONFERENCE CRIME DRAMA</strong><p></p><p><strong>Even during a bear market, crypto conference tickets sell out fast.</strong></p><p><em>Would-be attendees who miss the tickets OTC, have to lobby for their lives doing deals behind the scenes.</em></p><p><em>But this is “web 3”, where nothing is as simple as it seems, and it pays to bend the rules: even more with MEV.</em></p><p><strong>A self-proclaimed group of “crypto enthusiasts” managed to trick the system for EthCC, purchasing 200 tickets with a plan to sell them on.</strong></p><p>But when the conference organisers stripped the NFTs of their metadata, the greedy ticket touts found themselves out of pocket.</p><p><strong>$68,000 for 200 useless tickets.</strong></p><p><strong>rekt.</strong></p><p><em>Here’s how it happened:</em></p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>This year, EthCC used an NFT ticketing system. The NFTs contain metadata which Unlock Protocol interprets and validates in order to allow the holder access to the conference.</strong></p><p>The tickets are non-transferable. Attempting to call the transfer function simply throws an error, then reverts the transaction.</p><p>EthCC tickets were sold in 5 batches. On Thursday the 23rd of March, the 3rd batch of 308 tickets sold out in just 3 minutes.</p><p><strong>10 tickets were sold via credit cards</strong></p><p><strong>98 tickets were sold via USDC</strong></p><p><em>And 200 tickets were scalped in USDC by a single user</em></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/ethcc/ethcc-secondticket-wave-the-foam-of-a-scalper-ee8d8c602492"">[source]</a></p><p><strong>The above figures make it easy to see why the EthCC organisers were so concerned.</strong></p><p>However, since the tickets are by nature not transferable, the scalper had to find a workaround, in order to get any utility from holding so many tickets.</p><p>To do this, the scalper created a dedicated Gnosis Safe contract for each ticket, with the intention of changing the owner of said contract, and therefore bypassing the non-transferability of the ticket. If the scalpers had done more research, they would have found that this plan was already flawed, as you can see with this example from 3 months ago, where <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xd0a031d9f9486b1d914124d0c1fcac2e9e6504fe/258"">this early bird purchaser tries to resell for 5 ETH</a>, and the purchase attempts fail.</p><p>The scalpers were so sure that they were onto a winner, that they went ahead and created a collection on OpenSea to try and start reselling them (<a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/wrapped-ethcc-2022"">This can be viewed and reported here</a>).</p><p><strong>Even though the tickets couldn’t be transferred, the EthCC team went one step further to defend themselves from the scalping scammers.</strong></p><p>By using the ticket refund mechanism, EthCC interacted with the contract function “expireAndRefundFor” with the method[1] input as 0 for each of the NFTs.</p><p><em>In other words, EthCC used the pre-implemented function meant for refunding users but with the refund input as zero.</em></p><p><strong>Scalpers - REKT.</strong></p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/06/ethcctout-function.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>The following charts detail the contract which was used to purchase the tickets.

There are multiple factors, including overshoot, overpopulation, climate change, peak oil, peak farmland, peak fertilizer, post-truth social media etc. It is likely that modern global capitalism cannot overcome these problems of its making, and the most immediate consequence is that politics will become increasingly polarized and unhinged. The world is going to enter a new, much more chaotic and unpredictable equilibrium dominated by anarchy, ecofascism, deglobalization and large scale human suffering.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Crypto’s original cypherpunk ethos may prove to be a lifeline as we spiral into an ever more volatile future.</strong></p><p>And with Aave and Curve entering their own DeFi-native stables into the ring, the competition is heating up.</p><p><em>It’s do or DAI for Maker DAO.</em></p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png""/></figure><p></p><blockquote><p>If you enjoy our work, please consider donating to our <a href=""https://gitcoin.co/grants/1632/rekt-the-dark-web-of-defi-journalism"">Gitcoin Grant</a>.</p></blockquote></section>"

The idea behind this theory, which was widely adopted after the GFC and exponentially reinforced with COVID, is that there are two different worlds: the world of financial markets, and the real world (as with the rebase token model where you have staking and bonding).</p><p><strong>Those two worlds are separated by a one-way membrane: if things go wrong in financial markets, they will go wrong in the real economy, but if things go a bit too well in financial markets, it won’t contaminate the real world with inflation.</strong></p><p>With this theory, the total Euro supply increased by 51% between Dec-14 2020 and Dec-21 2021, while GDP grew 10% and CPI 11%.</p><p>This means that there is a 30% inflation pocket held in financial markets (record high levels for stock indexes in the middle of the Covid recession), which is only waiting for a small trigger to flood the real world economy.</p><p>Just like for rebase tokens, when the APY of the staking contract reduces below a certain level, funds start to outflow, and the token price collapses. This logic led the ECB to keep printing money, causing negative or nearly negative rates, and now that fears of rate hikes emerge, the bank run has started, with &gt;10% increase in consumer prices in 2022 and EUR/USD losing 20% of its value.</p><p><strong>EU Destroying trust in the currency kills the privilege of the dominant:</strong></p><p>The aforementioned modern monetary policy also worked thanks to the privilege of the dominant. This is an effect which benefits dominating currencies (mainly USD, and to a lesser extent, the Euro): where your trade deficit is financed by your financial excess.</p><p><strong>To put it simply: counterparties from which you buy goods lend you the money you need to buy them, taking as guarantee your currency, which you can mint out of thin air. They are willing to do that because they believe your currency is solid and a good store of value, just like gold. That’s how the US is able to sustain massive trade deficits and debt without any problem, and it’s the same for Europe.</strong></p><p>However, with the so called sanctions taken against Russia following the Ukraine war, and the decision to “freeze” Russian assets therefore defaulting on the debt held by Russia, (an unprecedented act, this didn’t even happen with German assets during WWII), the US and the EU destroyed the trust in their currency.</p><p>BRIC countries started to reduce their treasury exposure to USD and Euro, and to refuse Euro payments. The Fed offset that risk with massive hikes, leading to a stronger dollar, but the ECB is stuck in 0% rates, with countries and companies totally addicted to free money.</p><p>With the Euro starting to decline, the rise of energy prices, and past inflation hitting back, Germany’s trade excess turned into a deficit, pushing the whole Euro-area into a massive trade deficit. Since the Euro is no longer accepted to pay for goods, commodities or energy from Russia (and probably other countries), any trade deficit leads to the Euro getting dumped for gold, USD, Ruble, etc. This creates long term pressure on the Euro, which needs to readjust to a level where the balance of payments is neutral again.</p><p><strong>One monetary policy for 27 national budgets:</strong></p><p>As for any rebase token, the winning strategy in the Eurozone is to be where the emissions are higher than the average monetary inflation. As emissions are basically a direct bijection with countries’ budget deficits, the best way for countries to maximize their balance of payments is to maximize their deficit. This way more money gets printed in their country, at nearly 0% interest rate, and the total inflation of the Euro is offset by the fact that you managed to pull the blanket to your side of the bed.</p><p>If you have a 15% budget deficit, but the Euro monetary inflation is 10% per year, you are effectively increasing your country’s liquidity by 5%. This creates a prisoner dilemma between countries, which was prevented by Maastricht’s requirement of a maximum 3% annual budget deficit in the Euro area, otherwise the country would receive sanctions.</p><p>With Covid, this 3% cap vanished, and now countries are fighting to have the highest deficit possible, sometimes through ridiculous measures (like France for example, that got so far in this game that they are now under review by the IMF).</p><p><strong>This system is clearly unsustainable. Trees never reach the sky. The Euro will fail by design.</strong></p><p><strong>Diverging monetary policy needs:</strong></p><p><strong>Last but not least, what could finally kill the Euro is a desperate need for radically different monetary policies between the “losers” of the EU (countries that got comparatively poorer since their entry in the EU, such as Italy), and the “winner”, namely Germany, who has a $100bn+ trade excess with other EU countries.</strong></p><p>The first countries to join the EU saw their debt skyrocket for the last few decades, and would benefit from a devaluing currency (as it would reduce the weight of their debt), while Germany, which has deep reserves mainly denominated in Euro bonds, would see their savings melt like snow in the sun.</p><p><strong>Yet this is the path the ECB is currently taking with their anti-fragmentation measures.</strong></p><p>This might be the unexpected downturn German officials didn’t see when they designed this domination system, and it might be a big reason for them to be willing to exit this common monetary policy they don’t control anymore.</p><p>A lot of experts already talk about solutions such as having two different Euros for northern and southern countries, but when a system is failing by design, any attempts to save it are just palliative care, extending the agony as long as possible…</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><blockquote><p>This rekt.news Blog post is an opinion piece.

Why 10 TRBs? We can see that the takeAmount is exactly 10*10^18</p><p>Next, the hacker calls the submitValue function to submit a request to change the $WALBT price. The function determines if the caller's stake amount has reached the pre-set takeAmount, which is why the attacker needs to first stake 10 TRB tokens (10^18 is decimal point).</p><p>This function will record the price submitted by the caller, in this case 50000000000000000000000000000000.</p><p>After the price is set, the hacker calls the createTrove function of the Bonq contract to create the trove(0x4248FD) contract, which is a contract of data recording, borrowing and liquidating. Next, the attacker stakes 0.1 $WALBT to the contract to perform a borrowing operation.</p><p>Normally, the borrowing amount should be &lt; 0.1 WALBT to ensure collateral rate in a safe range. But in this contract, the calculation of the collateral value is via TellorFlex contract. The attacker has already raised $WALBT price, thus being able to borrow 100M $BEUR.</p><p>The hacker sets $WALBT to a low price in 2nd TX. When the $WALBT price is extremely low, the stake rate of WALBTs staked by other users will be at liquidation, enabling hacker to liquidate $WALBT staked by other users at low cost, eventually obtaining ~114M WALBT.</p></blockquote><p>—</p><p><strong>Losses have been widely reported to be up to $120M, using the tokens’ prices at the time of the hack.

That’s the short answer. Now let us describe our investigation a bit more.</p><p>When we found out that the Netherlands had taken the unprecedented step of arresting the Russian developer Alexey Pertsev and holding him without charges, we felt compelled to investigate. Such an action is far from business-as-usual for the Dutch government, and they wouldn’t necessarily do so unless the matter was very serious. At the same time, there was so little information out publicly on the arrest barring one small government press release that linked Pertsev to Tornado Cash and money laundering– and when we asked government spokespersons for comment, they refused.</p><p>So we started to poke around for answers, and as we did that, we noticed there were two different ways this story was being framed. On one side you had cryptonatives framing Alexey Pertsev as a completely innocent programmer who contributed open-source code in the name of privacy and nothing else. On the other side – mainly mainstream media in the US and The Netherlands – Pertsev was being labeled as an accomplice in a large-scale money laundering operation. We thought to ourselves: surely it’s not so black-and-white, and that was exactly what we came to find out.</p><p>Context is everything when telling a story, but the thing is with a documentary on such a fringe topic such as Tornado Cash and privacy on Ethereum, setting up the context was not a walk in the park. It felt like every time we had to mention something important, we had to do a segment to explain what the hell that thing even is. So although Alexey Pertsev’s arrest is the starting point to this investigation, this film is a much deeper exploration into the debates surrounding the future of privacy in finance, programming, free speech, and DeFi. With four insightful interviews along the way, we lead you up to the first trial date and set up the stage for a follow-up once the next trial comes along.</p><p><strong>rekt: How was the mood at the court? Who did you speak to and which other press organisations were there?</strong></p><p><strong>Marvin:</strong> The mood was subdued for the most part. In the defi world a lot of what people do is remote, so it was a bit curious to see different faces from different parts of the community coming together in Den Bosch to witness this trial. And obviously for Pertsev’s wife and family/friends who were there, the mood was tense.</p><p>Off the top of my head we spoke to Eleonore Blannc from CryptoCanalCommunity and Jack Schickler from Coindesk, as well as people from the mainstream Dutch media NOS and BNR. Dotted amongst the crowd were also a couple people from the cypherpunk community.</p><p>We happened to be sitting right behind Pertsev a couple rows back, just a few meters to the right of his wife Xenia. So we kept seeing Pertsev looking back over his shoulder to make forlorn eye contact with her, sometimes holding his hand over his heart. It was the first time they were seeing each other in well over three months, so that was pretty heavy to observe.</p><p>One curious thing at the trial is that the court assigned Pertsev a translator, this older Russian-speaking woman, but she had no background in crypto so she was being tasked to translate all types of technical terms such as DAOs, blockchain, TORN tokens, etc. She kept having to ask the prosecutor to slow down in her statements, and I wonder just how difficult that made it for Pertsev to follow along during the trial. He was getting information much later than those of us who speak Dutch.</p><p><strong>rekt: Do your team have personal opinions on how this case should be resolved, and if so, did you find it challenging to remain impartial when presenting the story?</strong></p><p><strong>Marvin:</strong> Perhaps this seems too easy of an answer, but this was a journalistic piece. If we didn’t remain impartial, not only would the factual telling of this story suffer, but we would also get fileted by the comment sections if we veered too much to one side. That’s also why this film features interviews with people on both sides, whether that’s a former Dutch government official or a developer friend of Pertsev’s.</p><p>As for how this case should be resolved, I don’t have a personal opinion just yet regarding the case in the Netherlands because we’ve only heard a fraction of the evidence in Pertsev’s case and his defense has barely had the chance to speak. I think I’ll have a more valuable personal opinion in a few months’ time when the next sessions of the trial take place.</p><p>As for the US, I do have an opinion: the courts must reverse OFAC’s sanctions. The sanctions are a blatant abuse of their power and if they manage to uphold these sanctions, OFAC will have free reign to attack other software in DeFi in a way that would make Gary Gensler proud – which scares me. The chilling effects on free speech are also worrying, so I’m rooting for CoinCenter’s petition against the courts.</p><p><strong>rekt: Was there anything you left out of the final edit which you feel is worth mentioning?</strong></p><p><strong>Marvin:</strong> There was quite a lot. I wanted to include a whole conversation on DAOs and how far they’ve veered from their idealist origins, but we’ll keep that for another film.</p><p>There was this one moment in the trial that was pretty odd. Basically, if Pertsev wanted to be free from jail until the next trial date, he would need to prove to the courts that he had a job awaiting him on the outside. Dutch law states that under the visa Pertsev had, he can’t go more than three months without working or his visa would be revoked, but since he had been in jail for months, he would basically need work right away or he would have to leave the country. That goes for his wife too, who is only allowed to stay based on his visa.</p><p>He is not allowed to work for PepperSec – his former company whom he founded along with the other core developers of Tornado Cash – so he needed a different job. But who would hire Pertsev just like that? It seemed unlikely. Then, when the trial continued followed the first recess of the day, his lawyer Keith Cheng returned late to the courtroom holding a stack of papers he claimed to have just printed, which was apparently a job contract from a company based in Thailand called Finstream that was willing to have Pertsev work remotely and provide him a visa in the Netherlands through a company called Expatrix. It seemed super rushed and last-minute – unprofessional really – but the juicy detail was that the owner of this Finstream company turned out to be Petr Korolev, the developer friend of Pertsev’s that we had interviewed weeks earlier. When they read out his name, Alp and I looked at each other like: “hmmmm interesting.”</p><p>Unfortunately for Pertsev, the judges didn’t see this arrangement as legitimate and decided to keep Pertsev in jail. Perhaps if the defense had presented it better they would have had a slim chance, but this seemed quite hopeless. Unfortunately for Xenia though, this probably means she has to leave the country and will not see Pertsev for a very long time. Her tears at the end of the trial made it seem that realization was entering her mind.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/12/waroncode-techbreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>A crypto mixer is clearly a controversial tool, and the Tornado core team were well aware of that before its release. However, regardless of outcome, this case will force every developer to question whether their code has some kind of illegitimate dual utility.</strong></p><p><strong>rekt:  Do you think this is really a “war on code”, or is it just a developer facing consequences for enabling criminal activity?</strong></p><p><strong>Marvin:</strong> I would not necessarily label the Dutch government’s actions as “war on code” just yet. That phrase is a bit more fitting for the actions of the US government, which I will elaborate on later.</p><p>In the Netherlands, there is an ongoing “war on money laundering” and Alexey Pertsev’s arrest is now a part of that. The government states that criminals launder approximately 16 billion euros in ill-gotten money each year within the Netherlands, and the tax authority’s Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) has been heavily targeting all sorts of money laundering operations for the past few years. For instance, last week the local RTL news published a piece on the FIOD clamping down on shady tourist shops in the center of Amsterdam that – despite being seemingly always devoid of paying customers – can somehow afford to pay the insane rent through selling Nutella waffles and generic souvenirs. Any Amsterdammer knows most of these are money laundering fronts and now it seems they’re finally getting targeted on a large-scale.</p><p>Judith de Boer, a lawyer featured in our film who specializes in cybercrime and money laundering, told us that the FIOD has been putting extra resources towards clamping down money laundering operations in the cryptosphere for years now. Already back in 2014 the focus was on so-called Bitcoin Cashers that allowed people to exchange bitcoins received through the Dark Web into cash. For Dutch prosecutors, putting together a case to charge people involved in these types of operations has been fairly simple (compared to Tornado Cash) because the criminal intentions are far more obvious. For instance, in one case the prosecutors could point to the fact that the suspect was openly advertising their illegal exchange service on the Dark Web, which basically proved his guilt.</p><p>While shutting down these Bitcoin Cashers was rather straightforward, holding anyone responsible for Tornado Cash is a much more difficult process. Tornado Cash was developed in the name of improving privacy on Ethereum, had very legitimate use cases, and operated in such a way there is no clear ownership. And while the majority of money flowing through the mixer was perfectly clean, around the equivalent of a billion dollars that went through Tornado Cash was tied to criminals. That’s a drop in the ocean in the world of money and only a fraction of the money that gets laundered in the Netherlands each year, but it appears the government is trying to set their foot down before the use of Tornado Cash and similar mixers becomes more common – and to discourage developers from contributing code to these mixers. That said, making an arrest was not so simple. Another EU lawyer of Russian descent that we spoke to (who wishes not to be mentioned) told us that the Dutch government had been investigating Pertsev for a long time now in order to build a case, but were forced to make an arrest after OFAC’s sanctions out of fear that he would flee. The lawyer said this was obvious because the authorities held him for the maximum amount of time without charges, over 100 days in total, allowing them to continue the investigation and build a case while Pertsev was locked up.</p><p>So while this isn’t per se “The Dutch War on Code,” this is the next phase in “The Dutch War on Money Laundering.” They are targeting Tornado Cash and similar mixers that sit outside the established laws of the land, and with Pertsev being located in the Netherlands, this was their opportunity to make a move. By bringing Pertsev to court, the government can now set a precedent for policing and holding accountable those who contribute and or operate crypto mixers – even if those mixers have legitimate use cases.</p><p>Of course, this trial is still ongoing and it remains to be seen how much responsibility can be pinned on Pertsev. I think I would be more worried about the outcome if Pertsev had only contributed code to the Tornado Cash protocol and done nothing else, which is how this case was being framed by many before the trial. But the first round of evidence suggests he was, in fact, partly involved in steering the operations of Tornado Cash through the DAO, that he did know about money laundering taking place, and that he appears to have benefitted in financially from fees collected by the protocol. With that in mind, it will be very interesting to see how the court talks about the DAO in legal terms and if any precedent will be set for judging the responsibility of a DAO in an illegal operation. DAOs are often heralded as truly decentralized organizations where no one party holds the most power, but as it turns out more often than not, they more resemble corporate governance structures where the biggest stakeholders (those who hold the most tokens) hold the most power, which appears to be the case with the Tornado Cash DAO. My question is: will  there be a moment in this trial or in future trials where the courts essentially say “You can call yourself a DAO all you want but it’s clear that the term DAO is just a cloak for hiding responsibility and we won’t accept it.”</p><p>Anyway, to round back to your question: Is this a war on code, or is this a developer facing consequences for enabling criminal activity? I think it’s more the latter. It’s a case of the government making an example of a developer in order to prevent others from creating anything that supports money laundering. But I don’t think they are specifically after open-source code.</p><p>I did mention earlier that I would be quicker to reserve the term “War on Code” for the American government's actions. The reason why I say this is because OFAC’s decision to place sanctions on Tornado Cash falls outside their statutory rights. As mentioned in the film, OFAC can only place sanctions on the assets, entities, or property of foreign persons – and Tornado Cash is none of those things. On top of that, the sanctions they placed almost exclusively affected Americans who interacted with those core immutable smart contracts of Tornado Cash, which as Peter van Valkenbergh states, is a radically different interpretation of OFAC’s rights. They are targeting software, not foreign assets. And if they can get away with placing sanctions on Tornado Cash, then what’s stopping them from sanctioning another open source software program like Linux?</p><p>At the end of the day, one thing that has been laid clear is the need for an alternative, secured, private, truly decentralized repository for hosting open source software. The fact that Github, which is owned by the multinational Microsoft, could suspend the accounts of the Tornado Cash developers just like that should be worrying. I’m not necessarily suggesting that Microsoft is colluding directly with the government to shut down these accounts, but seeing that Microsoft does defense contracting for the government, they will have a financial incentive to appease the government by doing so. And that to me is a big problem.</p><p><strong>rekt:  Do you think there is a hidden motive behind Pertsev’s arrest?</strong></p><p><strong>Marvin:</strong> The main motive is to clamp down on money laundering through cryptocurrencies. Now, if there is a hidden motive, it’s that the government knows it cannot keep up with just how rapidly technology is advancing in the cryptosphere and that in order to maintain the upper hand, they are making a public example of a developer to prevent coders from doing whatever they want.</p><p><strong>rekt:  How can we allow for on-chain financial privacy without enabling actors such as North Korea, who we know have benefitted from access to Tornado Cash?</strong></p><p><strong>Marvin:</strong> I’m not sure I can provide a good answer yet. During the making of this film I’ve asked myself a similar question many times, but have yet to come across a technology that I believe can provide financial privacy on a large-scale in DeFi without enabling illicit activity. Whatever the answer ends up being, I wouldn’t be surprised if zkSNARKS is a part of it.</p><p><strong>rekt: In your video, you point out that open source code is protected by free speech laws, but how long can that last? And what will happen once that protection is gone?</strong></p><p><strong>Marvin:</strong> In the US, the right to publish open-source code is protected by the free speech laws of the first amendment and has been upheld by the Supreme Court on various occasions. I do not foresee that changing any time soon. Like I mention in the video, just this year the US courts upheld the right to publish open-source code for creating 3D-printed guns under free speech laws (Defense Distributed vs US Department of State). If that’s allowed, then open source code – especially code that has no malicious usage – will remain protected for a very long time to come.</p><p>That said, should a case go all the way up to the Supreme Court that somehow removes free speech protections on open source code, then you should be very worried (and consider fleeing) as your right to publish pro-DeFi articles will also be in jeopardy.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/12/waroncode-pressbreak.png""/></figure>

I view The Block as one of the few professional news outlets in crypto and it was disappointing to see it was being <em>secretly</em> funded by one of the biggest players in the same industry they cover, presenting a clear conflict.</p><p>It’s not the funding in itself that’s the most troubling as media companies owned by billionaires, conglomerates and funds are able to deliver professional reporting with the right standards in place. What’s troubling is the questions that remain unanswered: why weren’t the loans made public, why were there personal loans made to The Block owner, and what was SBF getting in exchange.</p><p>Given their excellent research and knack for scoops, it was also surprising that the team was surprised. That said, they remain some of the strongest content teams in the space and they’ll come back from this.</p><p>But the episode does highlight the dire need for truly independent, professional and unbiased reporting in crypto. Too much content in this space is basically PR for projects, companies and tokens, pushed by projects themselves or by their VCs. Crypto is hard enough to navigate for users and investors, and the task is made even harder when you can’t trust many news outlets and content creators covering the space.</p><p>We need actual journalism in crypto, facts and data-based reporting, bringing much needed transparency and accountability. Otherwise this industry will never live up to the promise of becoming a better financial system. These are the principles under which The Defiant was founded and it’s what guides us every day.</p><p><strong>rekt: Has SBF, or any other character in crypto, ever approached The Defiant with a similar proposal?</strong></p><p><strong>Camila:</strong> I haven’t been offered a penthouse in the Bahamas yet lol. But seriously, no, we haven’t been approached by SBF or anyone else with a proposal of this size. But PR companies and projects themselves are constantly pitching and asking us to pay for editorial coverage. We invariably turn each of them down as all our sponsorships are disclosed and treated as ads, while our editorial content is never paid for and always published on the basis of how newsworthy and relevant for our audience each item is. I also turn down offers to use my personal Twitter account for promoting projects.</p><p>The number of offers we receive makes it very clear this is a common practice in the space, which to me is simply unacceptable as it means deceiving your audience and publishing content that’s not journalism but advertising.</p><p>We may be losing out on some revenue in the short term, but we’re here for the long term, and our reputation and the trust gained from our community is worth more than what we could earn with those deals.</p><p><strong>rekt:  How do you think crypto journalism should approach the issue of holder bias when it comes to covering crypto assets? Is portfolio disclosure enough?</strong></p><p><strong>Camila:</strong> It’s a complicated issue that I don’t think has a clear-cut answer. We’re in the process of formulating a policy around investments for our content team that goes beyond just disclosure.</p><p>At Bloomberg, where I used to work, reporters could not hold any asset in the industry they covered. I held that view until I started writing about DeFi, where experimenting and using the different protocols is essential to being able to report on the space well. Given that reporters need to hold crypto to do their jobs, disclosing their holdings is a start, but probably not enough.</p><p>The next question is, should holdings be limited? For example, should a journalist covering MakerDAO have most of their savings in MKR? I don’t think that would yield the best reporting. But that policy is easier to implement in large teams, with clearly delineated beats. In our case, reporters have very broad beats, and end up covering a bit of everything. Still, I think it could make sense to cap token holdings at a percentage of total investments, for example, a policy could be no journalist should have more than X % of their assets in a single token.</p><p>The other question that would need to be considered is, what if a cryptocurrency is meant to be something equivalent to the US dollar – the reserve currency of the ecosystem the reporter is covering. I think it can be argued that BTC and ETH have gained something close to that status. It would be unthinkable to cap reporters’ holdings of the fiat currency of the country they are living in. Should we cap holdings of ETH and BTC? I’m still not sure what the answer is.</p><p></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png""/></figure><p></p><p><strong>Engagement is down, prices are down, but crypto arrests are up only.</strong></p><p>Journalists and lawyers in our industry have a busy time ahead, as each seeks to document and decide on the unprecedented issues raised by crime and code.</p><p>Is this alternate economy even more corrupt than the original?</p><p><em>rekt.</em></p></section>"
